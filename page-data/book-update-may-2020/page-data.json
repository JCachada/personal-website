Some of them were bad because I hadn’t had enough practice to iron out some kinks in my writing. And some of them were bad because I didn’t work on them enough. Something which I’ve come to understand is that I’ve written a lot of books, but I haven’t finished a lot of them. That’s because I skipped one of the main steps: editing.</p>\n<p>Someone said once that editing is when you make it look like you knew what the hell you were doing when you wrote your first draft. I find that to be an accurate description.</p>\n<p>When I look back at all the stuff I’ve written before, I see a lot of potential in it, but no coherent solid body of work. That’s because I didn’t take the time to edit it appropriately, to gain some distance and then look on it and try to improve it with a bird’s eye view of the entire story. I sort of just went at it and wrote.</p>\n<p>That’s why with this book I’m expecting to take the rest of this year to call it “done”, even though I’m almost done with the first draft before the year reaches the halfway mark. I will then have to let it rest for a slight while, do an entire readthrough with a plot edit, then do some line editing and correct any typos or weird wordings, then send it out to beta readers and adjust according to feedback. Yes, that’s a formal outline of the steps the book will have to go through for me to consider it done. I expect to be done with all these steps this year still.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, a lot of the updates will simply illustrate how far along this path I am. Therefore, they’ll be quite short, unless I come up across some problem or subject I find interesting and want to talk about.</p>\n<p>Some of these stages will also imply a lower level of involvment on my end. When that happens, I’ll take the extra time to give some of my other projects attention, like my ongoing videogame. However, to make it perfectly clear, the book will always take priority, as it is my main goal for this year. I will only look at other stuff when my input is not needed on the book or when I have extra time remaining: for instance, when I’m waiting on beta reader feedback.</p>\n<h2>Current state of things</h2>\n<p>As it stands, I’m about 110.000 words in and working on the first draft of what I expect to be the last couple of chapters. I want to hopefully finish the first draft this month, although that might be a slightly ambitious goal. We’ll see.</p>\n<p><strong>Current word count</strong>: 103.810 words\r\n<strong>Current goal</strong>: Finish first draft.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Update #1: First Drafting","date":"May 02, 2020","description":"A general update on the state of the book as of May 2020, plus some musings on first drafting."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/book-update-may-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/mission-statement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mission Statement: This blog, the website, and more."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/finding-a-gameplay-loop/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dev Diaries #1: Finding a Gameplay Loop"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1923641857","2729794218","2744905544","3129532594","642825376"]}
