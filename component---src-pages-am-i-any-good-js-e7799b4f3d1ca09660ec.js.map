That's a big part of why the career switch\r\n                  worked. I'm always looking to learn new skills.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  I'm driven and passionate about quality.

And because I like learning so much, I tend to\r\n                  think everyone coming from a different place than me has\r\n                  something they can teach me.\r\n                </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n            </p>\r\n          </section>\r\n          <header>\r\n            <h3\r\n              style={{\r\n                marginTop: 0,\r\n                marginBottom: rhythm(1 / 4),\r\n              }}\r\n            >\r\n              Sounds like a lot of corporate talk...\r\n            </h3>\r\n          </header>\r\n          <section>\r\n            <p></p>\r\n            <p>Okay, you're right.
