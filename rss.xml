I’d like to say “hey, the book’s ready, and I just stopped writing these updates because I wanted to get it done as soon as possible.” Unfortunately, that isn’t what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go too deeply into why I haven’t posted an update in a while. In short, life happened. My stepfather became physically violent and I had to deal with that, which meant a lot of added strife in dealing with my mother and my younger brother. I removed myself from that situation, and I’m currently in the process of buying an apartment because of it. And there’s a massive pandemic raging that’s got everyone a little bit on edge. The pandemic I’d grown used to dealing with, but everything else got the better of me and made the updates stop for a little while. You can see that I played through and wrote a detailed Cyberpunk 2077 review in that time, so it wasn’t as much that I didn’t have the time to write, but more that I didn’t really have the heart to share. I felt like with everything happening around me I didn’t have the mental energy to progress as quickly as I wanted to, and consuming art is much less demanding than trying to make it (and the same is true of writing about someone else’s art). While I never stopped working on the book, I couldn’t exactly come up with a good reason for why I wasn’t making enough progress besides “yeah, shit happened, I need some time”, and that didn’t seem like a good enough reason to me. In retrospect, it would’ve been better than stopping updates altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on returning to regular updates now that things have calmed down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updates took a hiatus: work on the book, however, didn’t, so let’s get back into it. We’ll start with a simple, short update for this month and go from there. For the March update I’ll consider writing a deeper blog post. I don’t want to spend too much time and energy coming up with lessons or content for blog posts while working on the book, so while I’ll write one of if there’s a topic I want to cover, there’s also the chance I’ll just update you guys on the word count and the progress for that month. This should give me the most time to actually work on the book, as well as give me some leeway with commitments to make sure I don’t get swamped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being interested, and I promise I won’t be gone nearly as long this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current word count&lt;/strong&gt;: 53.130
&lt;strong&gt;February goal&lt;/strong&gt;: 60.000 words on the second draft.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Review: Do nomads dream of organic hearts?]]></title><description><![CDATA[A few words on the buzz This is sort of an editorial note.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is sort of an editorial note. Please skip it if you just want the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 is, as of the date of writing this, the first single-player game to reach 1 million concurrent players on Steam, as well as the first game to ever get that achievement on the same day it got released. It is, by and large, the biggest single-player game in Steam history to date, and that’s not even counting consoles, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. The amount of expectations and engagement leading up to the game’s release is immense; but besides the crazy sales numbers that brings, there are also slightly more nefarious consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any popular product, some people feel compelled to dislike it simply because of its popularity, as if contrarianism is a way of self-affirmation. I am not one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any popular product, some people use the swirl of negativity as a way to dismiss valid criticism of the game as it stands. I am also not one of those people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been through this before. In March 2017, Mass Effect: Andromeda got released, carrying on its shoulders the weight of the entire Mass Effect series. From reading online discussion at the time, I was convinced people had decided to hate the game before it ever came out. In the months that followed the release, the game was demolished by critics and the public alike, to an extent that, no matter what your final opinion on Andromeda is, wasn’t warranted. Whatever the game got wrong, it also got a lot of things right; and nowadays, with some distance between players and the release buzz, it tends to be much better received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I bring up all of this? Simply to give some context to the review below. I pre-ordered Cyberpunk 2077 because I knew I would play it even if the reviews were horrible. I played through the entirety of the main story and a large majority of the side content at my own pace, on my Playstation 5, and didn’t partake in any discussion of the game until I was done with it. What I know about the buzz surrounding it, I know from talking to friends. Much like with Mass Effect: Andromeda, I did my best to solidify my thoughts on the game before I wrote about it. Frankly, I didn’t even know if I wanted to write about it until after I’d finished.
Now, however, I feel like I’ve got a good enough grasp on what I think of the game to analyze it with some productivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A crisis of identity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite interesting to me that the central conflict of Cyberpunk 2077 happens around V’s fading identity and its progressive replacement with Johnny Silverhand’s engram, because in a way the ways one can criticize the game the most come from a similar crisis of identity. In Cyberpunk, two different games are at odds with each other, and I would like to review each of them separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk the open-world game isn’t particularly good. The NPCs that populate the world are, by and large, uninteresting. While the first ten hours had me gawking at their designs, finding out everything I could about their implants, seeing all the cool ways in which people modified themselves in this new world, and scanning them for every bit of extra info, that’s about all that you get out of them. Their dialogue is repetitive and bland, and often, completely inappropriate for the situation around them (for instance, NPCs inside areas that I’d been explicitly invited to enter were oddly insistent on telling me to fuck off or asking me who I was in a very hostile tone). You’ll hear the same voice line repeated by nameless characters on opposite sides of the map, and you’ll count yourself lucky if a different voice actor is doing the saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nameless NPC routines are also not very good. Characters spawn just outside of your range of vision and, on more than one occasion, inside it. They walk very clearly predefined loops and handle deviation poorly, which is to say, not at all. To top it all off, their design seems to influence their lives in no discernible way; I saw NPCs decked out in chrome prowling the seediest neighborhoods in Night City like they lived there, and roughed up looking children hanging out around Arasaka Tower like it was their home. As far as I can tell, there is no clear division that determines what nameless characters in each area, beyond some very obvious delimitation like “you will see Voodoo Boys in Voodoo Boys turf and not some other gang.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are no mini-games, and most of the world is beyond your capacity for interaction. I will admit I think the complaint that there are no mini-games is a bit silly – not every game needs to be Yakuza – but, as someone who put over 1000 hours into Witcher 3’s Gwent standalone, I understand the appeal. Mostly, the issue is that Night City often feels just beyond your reach. Especially for the first few hours after you’re dropped right in the middle of it, there is a clear loop of seeing something cool, attempting to interact with it, and discovering there’s no interaction available besides just witnessing the something cool. This repeated effect can at times get a bit frustrating and give you a sense of missed opportunity. A great example of this would be braindances. It seems clear that braindances were supposed to be in the game to a greater extent. You can buy them from vendors, they’re not categorized as junk, and you have the ability to consume them on the fly. Yet none of them are actually in the game for you to experience; instead, you buy the braindance and have a disappointing “oh, I guess I can’t do that” moment. Many of these little moments compound into making the world feel less deep and immersive than other open-world experiences, like Red Dead Redemption 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you get to the other Cyberpunk - the roleplaying game Cyberpunk, the narratively driven experience Cyberpunk, the character-focused Cyberpunk, and this is where the game shines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the shallowness of its open world, Cyberpunk has none of it in its narrative efforts. Quests appear organically in your journal through a very elegant system where finishing jobs increases your reputation, which in turn makes people trust you more, which in turn makes both clients and fixers give you better, more dangerous, and more frequent jobs. On top of this, many of the game’s cooler quests show up organically on your map if you take the time to explore Night City. For instance, one quest had me talking to a sentient soda-dispenser machine in a back alley as it guided its assorted clients through the issues in their life in a weird, unexpected AI-therapy session. I could’ve missed that quest entirely had I not gone into that particular alley. Yet Cyberpunk’s world is chock-full of interesting little tidbits and assignments like these that make traveling in it a delight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to a different point: Night City is, on all counts, a delight. If I had to pick one thing from this game that felt truly next-gen and trailblazing for other games to come, it is the sheer level of detail, care, and craftsmanship put into the city itself. For the first five hours of my playthrough, I stood in awe as I explored every nook and cranny of every bathroom and found in it something new every time: from thinly veiled references to Ex Machina and other sci-fi staples to a random phone call you can overhear if you stand at just the right spot, and including the sheer beauty of the environments around you. Night City oozes atmosphere, and more than once I walked (yes, walked - driving doesn’t do the city justice, and fast traveling bypasses it entirely) to a quest only to stop multiple times on the way there simply to admire the aesthetic sense and composition of what I was looking at. In that sense, Cyberpunk is a game to be experienced slowly, with care and attention. You’ll get as much out of the city as you put into exploring it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/c99cd138e0a4dd2f75a0c9d17f1c1e99/cyberpunk-aesthetic.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image info&quot; title=&quot;Look at how pretty the city is&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the narrative sense, Night City is a full-blown character, and one of the best in the game. Everyone you meet is clearly and explicitly influenced by it. It weighs on the mind of everyone, and exists far beyond its architecture, instead giving body to everyone’s sense of identity. In the same way that American identity has long been tied to the land itself, the identity of Night City inhabitants is predicated largely on being a part of it. There is no passive living in this town, no “I’m from Velen but I could just as well be from Novigrad”, and certainly no “what I do here, I could do anywhere else in the world”. For the people who live there, Night City is the central axis around which their life revolves – either by trying to get something from it or by trying to get away from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, one of the endings (the one I got, but more on that later) specifically moves the characters away from this. Panam introspectively comments that she came to Night City looking for something that was missing from her life, and now she finds herself leaving again, and once again hoping that the move will allow her to find the missing piece. V then comments that “(…) you thought Night City was the answer. Everything would change there. (…) Might be the same place on the other side [of the border], same space. But you’re different, totally different.” Night City is overwhelmingly resistant to meaningful change, but it does act as a catalyst for change in those that live in it. It’s no small irony that the move away from having the physical space be a central part of your identity comes to V and Panam only when they’re forced to leave it. The megalopolis’ tendrils are so strong that even the refusal of the importance of place, of physical space, when compared to the people in it, is a direct consequence of the realities of a particular physical space. Anyone who’s ever been an ex-pat will find familiarity here: it’s not the place that makes the experience, but it sure as hell sets it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh, the humanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sam Mendes’ 1999 motion picture American Beauty, the main character, Lester Burnham, comments: “I have lost something. I’m not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn’t always feel this… sedated.” Pinpointing the exact cause for this disenfranchisement is difficult. N. Katherine Hayles comments that “contemporary technology (…) has given us the sense that we can transcend these [bodily] limitations and live a disembodied, free-floating existence.” Like Hayles, plenty of others attribute to technology, and man’s evolving relationship with it, the particular brand of problems of the mind that afflict current times. We feel disconnected from things around us, surrounded by people but deeply alone, alienated by cold neon signs and faceless, ethereal corporations that determine our quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk (the movement, not the game) gives expression to this disenfranchisement, but it’s a hard genre to get right. Someone too invested in the problem, or suffering too markedly from it, might commit the mistake of overdoing the cynicism. Like many art pieces in recent years, Cyberpunk could’ve been unabashedly gloom, revel in its own hopelessness. Games (and really, any sort of media) attempting to cover the cold detachment of ultra-tech and its worlds run the risk of producing the same sense of coldness, detachment, and lonesomeness in whoever plays them. This, for me, isn’t the point. It’s too easy – it feels like a copout, a defeatist throwing of the towel and a catharsis coming from giving up the responsibility to do better by, instead, simply going: “Yup, we’re all fucked.” The monumental challenges of a cyberpunk world wouldn’t feel genuine if they didn’t feel overwhelming. Yet to simply let yourself be overwhelmed by them is cheap and uninspired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD Projekt Red’s writers, however, are very aware of the danger here, and the result is a game that accurately reflects the sense of alienation one would get from an ultra-tech world, without ever letting go of the sense of intimacy and low scale human problems that make stories engaging. In many ways, the sense of humanity is enlarged because of the contrast with the cyberpunk setting; pretty much every major named NPC you encounter in your story missions is yearning for some human connection, and Night City is packed with communities of people trying to survive the disenfranchisement by banding together over something. That something might not always be the best or noblest reason, and the outcomes are often less than ideal, but the drive is there, the fundamental human need for a sense of kinship; even in the highest embodiment of the corporate world that the game presents to you, Yorinobu Arasaka. Let no one tell you Yorinobu commits patricide out of a lust for power – he does so because his father denies him the human solace he so desperately craves. It makes sense that the yearning is more acute the deeper into the corpo world you dive into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, the writing in the game is unfortunately inconsistent. While none of the side quests are particularly boring, and a clear separation exists between side quests and gigs (which are more in the vein of radiant and fetch quests with slight story additions, as opposed to the bulkier, better thought-out side quests), the truth is most of them aren’t particularly memorable either. A lot of them feel like they deserved further exploration. In one particular example, a quest about helping a family of high-ranking politicians turned out to be an exploration of the role of memories in personal identity; yet it ends abruptly, and without giving you the chance to pursue it any further. The world’s most interesting cab-driving AI gives you a delicious side-quest full of AI-centric references to other sci-fi classics, yet after your final decision, you never hear from it again. Many of the side quests feel like very satisfying Act 1s, begging for calls that never came, for a continuation later in the game that wraps everything up with a bowtie. There are some exceptions, of course, mainly revolving around the central named characters of Judy, Panam, and River; but I can’t help but wish all of these other interesting quests also got similar continuations in the later acts. Even though the writing in the bits that are there feels very strong, and any side quest you do here will have a more engaging storyline than anything you’ll find in something like Grand Theft Auto, they do feel a bit unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The (not so) Badlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to talk about what was possibly my favorite part of the entire game: the Badlands, and the central Panam questline revolving around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I visited the Badlands was in the course of the main story, in a Panam-related quest that had me attempting to bring down an AV containing a VIP important for progressing the main plot. Before the inevitable shooting sequence, Panam stops her car on a cliff overlooking Night City and V comments on how quiet it is here. Panam laughs, and comments on how the picture is ruined by the smell of the coyotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Badlands feel completely out of place in Night City, and for good reason. The concrete and neon skyscrapers of the megalopolis are replaced by what is mostly desert, poor roads, and abandoned gas stations. You can actually see the ground here, and there’s natural vegetation, bushes, and trees everywhere. It wasn’t until I ventured out into the Badlands that I realized just how oppressive Night City had been to walk; walking here felt freeing, wide, empty, and welcoming in its serenity. Sure, there are nasty sandstorms and a gang of rapists and murderers waiting to jump on you if you venture too far away from safety; but the world out there feels anachronistic, definitively slower, and decidedly more human than the bustling city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panam herself bothered me at first. I refused to help her murder an entire clan of people just because they’d stolen her car, and the fact that she’d asked me to made her look like an immature, hotheaded bother. For the most part, that judgment was accurate. Yet as the game progresses and pits Panam and the Aldecaldos against increasingly dangerous, city-folk foes (Rogue to begin with, then Militech, and then Arasaka at the culmination), she not only matures but also demonstrates that her head is in the right place. The Aldecaldos are a pocket of family in the world of Cyberpunk 2077, one you got an inkling of when Jackie mentioned his bout with the Valentinos; but that disappeared with him. They’re tribal to a fault, and they are willing to do anything for one of their own - even breaking into Arasaka against very unfavorable odds. They are, themselves, anachronistic in a lot of different ways. Cassidy, the cowboy old-timer, refuses to wear cybernetic enhancements (he doesn’t trust chrome); Carol serves as the cool matriarch-like aunt who gives you romantic advice about her protegé; and Mitch is the decorated war vet who hasn’t gotten over things, even though he has a good heart to him. Their leader, Saul, is stuck in the old ways as well, attempting to survive by doing jobs for corporations, refusing to acknowledge that the strategy will only work as long as the corps don’t feel the inexplicable urge to crush them. Panam is too far removed in the opposite direction, filled by the same fire for action Johnny exhibits, but she shows some surprising self-awareness of her own limitations, more than once explaining that she needs Saul to temper her if she’s to not lead everyone into their deaths. In a world where every other outdoor you see on the street is for porn, Panam rejected my advances at first because she was too guarded to get involved. Family, for the Aldecaldos, is something much more serious than for most of Night City, in every aspect of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game progressed, it became clear that the pull the Aldecaldos had on V - enough to make him drop any quest he was on when they called – was the same pull they had on me: they felt like a pocket of authenticity in an otherwise alienating world. Not the only one, of course; Judy and River both provide this authenticity, in their own way. Yet something about the anachronistic old-fashionedness of the nomad clan kept me coming back to them; perhaps there were other places where you could find that sort of undying loyalty in Night City, but nowhere else can you sit in the desert watching the stars while someone plays the guitar around a campfire. Night City is still there, its neon signs serving as background pollution; but around the Aldecaldos, even that doesn’t look so bad.
When the time came during the end of the game to decide who to call, there was no question for me: I had to reach out to Panam. And she replied in the way I expected and valued, by going: “So you’re telling me you woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me that you need to get into Arasaka tower or you’ll die?” V replied: “That’s about it, yeah.” To which Panam replied “Okay.” No hesitation: there is a sense of unspoken respect underlying the conversation that makes it so no other question is needed. Panam trusts you to be competent, and she trusts that you know the full weight of what you’re asking for. I would’ve understood if she said no – but she never would’ve, and neither would any of the Aldecaldos. That sense of trust in your community is by all counts a bad idea; it is, in itself, anachronistic in relation to the world of Cyberpunk; there is a very strong case for how idealistic and naive it is. And yet the Aldecaldos survive, they pull off the heist on Arasaka tower, and they leave the city behind while a song straight from the 80s in mood starts playing. Perhaps that is why the Aldecaldos must exist just outside of Night City, the place that crushed that old-timey sense of community in the first place: because that is the one place where it can survive, outside of the corporate borders. And perhaps that is why Panam mellows and matures as she removes herself from her Night City life and approaches the Aldecaldos again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s talk ingenuity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking to one of my friends about the ending I got (I left Night City with the Aldecaldos, with Panam taking solo leadership of the clan), he mentioned how he liked it, but thought it was quite bittersweet; what with V being terminally ill and all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him I disagreed: I thought the ending was fully sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Alt Cunningham told me that my body was too far gone and that, were I to return to it, I would die shortly after, I thought it was a stroke of genius by the writing team. What could have been the expression of a simple personal preference, or an extension of curiosity towards cyberspace, became a choice that reveals the general outlook of the player towards the central questions of Cyberpunk 2077. Much like the final “Help Olgierd” or “Do Nothing” encapsulated in a single question the entire Faustian debate towards redemption in Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone, here you’re asked to answer a simple, incredibly consequential question in one simple decision: “Do you hope?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to upload yourself into cyberspace is a recognition of the fallibility of the human form, and an acceptance of the disconnection and cold detachment, personified by Alt, as an inevitability towards survival. It is, in many ways, the only decision that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to return to your body, however, is the human choice. Much like the Aldecaldos themselves, this choice is the human sense of ingenuity expressing itself in an anachronistic way. There is no fatalism in it; the game itself recognizes multiple times that V still hopes to cure his disease in the six months that he has left. Whether he manages to do so or not is mostly inconsequential: but damned if he won’t try it. In the final decision of the game, Cyberpunk puts the genre trap in your hands and asks you: “Do you want this story to be about how much the world sucks, and people have to suck to survive in it? Or do you want it to be about how this world sucks, and people still manage to not follow suit?” I’m partial to one option, but the appreciator of narrative construction in me can’t help but be impressed by how the team at CD Projekt Red honored the roleplaying aspect of the RPG, and let you decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire game, I rebuked and admonished Johnny for his unbridled hate towards anything corp. Extremism of the sort, I thought, was equally bad. I still heavily dislike Johnny’s personality (even though he’s a well-written character). Yet where his brand of resistance failed miserably(with even the nuclear bombing of Arasaka Tower failing to cause any meaningful change), the Aldecaldos resist the corpo rule just as much. In a way, they resist it much more effectively – not by flailing around and raging at the machine, and not by sitting still and doing nothing (they still raid convoys and steal tech, and they still assault Arasaka when needed) but by grounding their resistance in principles deeply alien to the corpo world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we left Night City behind, V and Panam hovered over a pond where the stars were reflected. This was no accident: in The Witcher series, Vilgefortz’s most famous line is “you mistake the stars reflected in the pond for the night sky.” And perhaps that is what V and Panam were doing, along with the entirety of the Aldecaldos, by insisting in their anachronistic ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when the night sky is this full of stars, maybe that’s not such a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

I had surgery this month (everything went well and I’m mostly recovered), which put a dent in my plans and timelines. Still, I wanted to do the monthly update anyway, which means I only had time to do it right as the month was ending. Next month things should return to normality, seeing as there’s no other surgeries or setbacks planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the above, this month will have no game update; I simply didn’t work on it enough to warrant a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, manage to work on the book a fair deal, and I had to chance to think about what it means to find your voice as a writer. That is the topic of today’s post. As usual, if you’re mostly interested in the word count update, scroll to the bottom of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stealing from the greats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question I come across very often on writing forums and conversations with aspiring writers manifests itself in some variation of: “Can I write about Y? This famous author already wrote a book that has the same concept.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never quite understood that concern. Imagine someone telling you that they didn’t want to watch &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; because they’ve seen &lt;em&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/em&gt; once. Or saying they don’t want to play &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; because they already played &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;, and they follow very similar tropes in different settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality of it is that concepts are worth very little in writing, and the execution is impossible to steal. Sure, there are a million space operas out there, and yours might not even be particularly interesting to a general audience, but it’ll be yours. No one can write the space opera you would write except you. So why not write it, and see what comes out of it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the issue that original concepts are extremely hard to come by. A great comparative literature researcher said once that originality died with Shakespeare, and everyone that came afterward was just retelling similar stories in different ways. In Philosophy, we sometimes say it died with Aristotle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, originality is fine and well. Yeah, maybe &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; isn’t that different from five other niche books most people haven’t heard about. So what? Can you imagine if George R.R. Martin didn’t write it because it wasn’t original enough? A large part of Neil Gaiman’s body of work is retelling old myths in his own, unique way. Can you imagine being deprived of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; because someone already wrote modern-day retellings of &lt;em&gt;Odin&lt;/em&gt; once? Or because American travel novels exist? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of writing my book, not once did I think about the originality of my concept. The central idea for the magic system is born out of a twist on Mistborn’s, a &lt;em&gt;what if&lt;/em&gt; that popped into my mind as I read it. One of the central points of conflict comes from one of Gaiman’s books, where I read something he wrote and went “oh, that’s cool. I’d like to try and do that.” And one of the primary sidekicks in the book comes straight from &lt;em&gt;The Luminaries&lt;/em&gt;, which isn’t even a fantasy novel! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen King often says that the first step to becoming a good writer is to read a lot, and read a lot of different things, often outside your comfort zone. That isn’t just because it’s good for your brain and it gives you perspective on what’s being done in writing today; it’s also because it gives you a good idea of who to steal from. You can’t take inspiration from other people without knowing what they’re doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I do, as I read throughout the year, is that I keep a notepad full of passages I enjoy reading, that I think work very well to elicit a specific mood, or that I just like for some odd reason. I jot down these passages over the year with no indication of what book, author, or series they belong to. After a while, I’ve got a good collection of them; and chances are that, when I’m struggling to find a way to describe a scene or to set the mood for something, I’ll be able to look in my little notepad and find a passage that works at doing what I want to do, or at the very least that inspires a mood in me. Then I get to adapt it to my book and try to put my spin on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I do is that, when I’m stuck on something, I explicitly go and look for books that I think do it well. Pat Rothfuss taught me this: I saw an interview of his once where he mentioned how he was awful at writing fighting scenes and had no idea where to even begin. So he picked up some William Gibson and tried to figure out how the fighting scenes were written in his books, and why it was they worked. He then realized Gibson never actually described any fighting in his fight scenes; the prose was more akin to dancing, a tug-of-war of the mind that also sometimes mentioned swords. He copied that technique and used it in &lt;em&gt;The Wise Man’s Fear&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a brilliant way of doing things. If I don’t know how to set the eerie mood for a particular scene, why not pick up some Lovecraft and try and figure out why he did it? In code, if I don’t know how to do something, I find someone who does, and I see how they’re doing it, then try to do better. Why should writing be any different? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this doesn’t mean you should blatantly copy other authors’ work. Using them to learn is fine, plagiarizing is not. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, and any writer, at their heart, is nothing but the combination of the art he’s been exposed to in his life, with his spin and personality thrown on top of it. But that’s the key aspect of it: it has to be yours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing voice, if you could hear it, would have to contain a lot of different ones. From Hemingway and Don DeLillo to Sapkowski and Gaiman. And I think my writing is all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Like a child&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, however, admit that I am too impressionable. Because of that, when doing revisions, I have to be careful with what I’m reading. Often I won’t read anything at all during the revision process, and when I do it’ll be non-fiction. This is because I’ll often find my writing voice changing to match the type of sentence construction, prose style, and overall themes of whatever book I’m reading at the moment. This can cause the end product to be a mash of different styles, where I sound like Hemingway, terse and to the point, for the first 5 chapters, then I pick up Martin and become gratuitously purple for the next 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sad as it is, not reading at all during the revision process helps me keep a coherent voice that I know is my own; and gives me a good excuse to read extra for the rest of the year, to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having surgery, I have hit the goal I set for myself last month. As the end of the year approaches, it’s time to build up the crunch a bit to make sure I stick to the goal of having the book done by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current word count&lt;/strong&gt;: 33.751
&lt;strong&gt;October goal&lt;/strong&gt;: 50.000 words on the second draft.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book Update #4: Changes vs Improvements]]></title><description><![CDATA[It’s becoming a bit of a habit to miss my word count goals with the second draft process, which indicates one of two things: I’m setting…]]></description><link>https://jcachada.dev/book-update-august-2020/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jcachada.dev/book-update-august-2020/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming a bit of a habit to miss my word count goals with the second draft process, which indicates one of two things: I’m setting goals that are too lofty, or I’m not giving enough of my time to the book. I recently spent some time thinking about which one it was, and I came to the conclusion that quarantine has sort of been affecting my productivity more than I had expected. My energy levels have been down a bit, and while I still produced thousands of words I’m happy with, this is not a rhythm that will allow my book to be ready still in 2020, which was always my goal. Therefore, my only course of action is to increase the amount of time I spend revising to meet my self-imposed deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still committed to having the book ready until the end of the year. It’s moving along, if a bit slower than expected. For word count updates, jump to the bottom of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing things doesn’t always mean they get better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in every creative endeavor, further revising starts bringing diminishing returns. Even the best writers can always find some flaw with their manuscripts after they’ve been edited and re-edited, gone through revisions multiple times, and thought over to exhaustion. One might even say all this revision can sometimes harm the writing itself: Ernest Hemingway wrote tens of possible endings to &lt;em&gt;A Farewell to Arms&lt;/em&gt;, and many people prefer some of the endings he left out to the one he ended up choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, I wrapped up the revision of the first chapter of my book. I talked last month about how I’d reworked some things to make exposition flow more naturally into the story, and most of those changes have survived. But when faced with the end product of my revision, I was also taken by the urge to revise it again. It makes sense, right? If you revise the writing, surely it makes sense to also revise the rewriting. And then revise that revision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if I did this, I would never write an actual book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To appease my inner editor, I came up with some practical compromises. One, I decided I would not revise my revisions. I’ve laid out a plan of what I think the editing process for this book will be - first a passthrough to fix plot and thematic coherence, add and remove scenes, rework what characters do at times; then a stylistic passthrough where I fix sentence construction and pretty everything up; then send it out to beta readers and change things based on their feedback; finally, the book will be done. I’m comitted to sticking to this plan, if nothing else to figure out how effective it actually is. I’ll introduce changes only after it’s had a chance to run its course, as I believe that’s the only way I’ll be able to identify possible shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two, because the above got my inner perfectionist screaming, I read both drafts of the chapter again, and I wrote up a list of things each of them did better than the other. For the sake of science, I will share a picture of that list below, as I wrote it on my notebook (yes, I write things in paper. A lot. It helps me slow down my mind and think through what I’m writing, whereas on the computer I type too fast for my brain to keep up). &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went through the things I thought the first draft did better, and I attempted to transfer them into the second draft. The exercise was suprising, in a sense, as some distance from the first draft allowed me to realize there were actually things it did quite well, and I didn’t want to do away with them. By taking the time to make sure they’re present in the second draft as well, I ensured that the second draft is a marked improvement over the first one (containing the same qualities, plus some improvements). The downside is that this took a fair bit longer than just taking the second draft as immediately better. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the exercise was effective in quieting my inner editor, though. Having a tangible sense of the ways in which the second draft was better than its previous iteration comforted me, and made me feel like I was moving in the right direction. Of course, there are still a thousand ways I see of rewriting the chapter, but if I explored each and every one of them to try and figure out the best, I would take years just to be done with this first section. I am happy with the improvements I’ve made, and with the chapter’s state in general after the first revision process. If I was asked by a shareholder to defend my product, I could give good reasons for why I chose to write it the way I did. For now, and considering that I won’t have an accurate picture of how this is perceived by readers until later in the whole process, my satisfaction will have to be enough. And frankly, it should be: what kind of book would this be if its own author, at least, didn’t think it was good? 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current word count&lt;/strong&gt;: 24.874 thousand words (second draft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Go up to 35 to 40 thousand words in the second draft.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dev Diaries #4: August Update - Implementing a Save Game System]]></title><description><![CDATA[As I’m still deep in working on my book to meet my goal of having it ready this year, I didn’t make any progress on the game this month.

I will therefore spend some time explaining how I implemented a rudimentary save / load game system in the game, as that’s a central part of any gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players make progress when playing a game - they discover new locations, get new items, gain XP and stats, and talk to new people. All of these changes, to a varying degree, must be persisted between play sessions. The player must not lose any progress if he turns off the game and then turns it back on again; this would make finishing the game very hard as soon as it had any degree of complexity, and it would demotivate players from investing time into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is especially true in a story driven game where your choices impact the plot: those choices cannot be lost, as they’re central to the narrative that you’re going to experience. So, how do you go about implementing a save game system? I decided to give it a go myself, as with most things in the game, to see if I could figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking down the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was attempt to break down the problem. What exactly did I need to save? Certainly, what level the player was in. Also, the characteristics of the player character; finally, the choices the player had made so far in conversation.
These all seemed relatively simple to store in a file on the user’s system, and so I only had to choose an easy format to store the data in. For convenience’s sake, I chose JSON. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a global file, called &lt;strong&gt;playervariables.gd&lt;/strong&gt;, and used it to store all the data related to the player that I wanted to save between sessions. It ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;	
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## This node is used to store variables that need to persist between multiple scenes. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## It&apos;s effectively responsible for handling saved games.&lt;/span&gt;

var currentScene&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# The scene the player was in at the time of saving.&lt;/span&gt;
var playerHealth &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# The health of the player character.&lt;/span&gt;
var kickedChest &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; false&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
var counter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Global story events / artifacts&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; files&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having the player variables stored here, I can easily access them from every scene when something happens that should change them. For instance, if you’re mean to your wife, I can do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;playervariables&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;WifeComfort &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; playervariables&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;WifeComfort&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From any scene in the game. Then, when the player saves the game, that value will be saved onto a JSON file in the user directory; and when the player loads a game, I’ll simply parse the values back onto their respective variables, and load the player into the correct scene. All the dialogue and other aspects of the game will react appropriately, because all of their checks will be using the variables in &lt;strong&gt;playervariables.gd&lt;/strong&gt; to verify a certain condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;saves_exist()&lt;/code&gt; needs to be there for UI purposes. When a player hits “Load Game”, I need to be able to tell if there’s any saved games available for me to show; if not, a different pop-up must indicate that. This function allows me to do that by checking for files with a .save extension, which I decided would be clear enough for the game’s save files, even though they’re glorified JSON files. This way I avoid any misunderstandings where an invalid JSON gets caught up in the listing of saved games available to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;get_all_saves&lt;/code&gt; allows me to list the saved games in a UI for the player to choose from. Right now this UI is a simple Godot list showing all of the saved games, but it can easily turn into a full blown loading screen. If I wanted to, I could even save a screenshot of the viewport at the moment of saving, so that upon loading them I could show each saved game with a picture of the place they left the player in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The downsides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main downsides to this approach; one isn’t really a big deal, the other might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that isn’t really a big deal is that saved games are easily manipulated. Since they’re just JSON files here, that means anyone can open them with a text editor and change the values; so if you wanted to trick the game into giving you 100 in WifeComfort or into thinking you talked to someone you didn’t, you could. I don’t really mind this, because this is meant to be a single player game; so if players want to manipulate their experience, let them. I’m not one to restrict what they want to do with the game - as long as the game I ship doesn’t break by default, players breaking it is something I’m perfectly fine with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside that might be a big deal is maintainability. With this approach, every event I want to keep track of needs to be a variable in the dictionary / file I’m saving. If the game grows big enough, this could be hell to manage. Imagine several different variables saying much the same thing: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;talkedToFirstChest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;talkedToSecondChest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wasMeanToThirdChest&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. These would all have to be managed both there and throughout the code, which can be very complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have somewhat tried to mitigate this second downside by dividing the file clearly by node for easy navigation, but it is still a concern I have. Still, this implementation seems to solve the problem of saving and loading games well enough for now; so I’ll just have to think up an alternative if it ever becomes a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the assets you see in the proof of concept are free assets I’m using for mocking purposes, and they come from itch.io. You can find several free asset packs to work with there, although most of them require crediting if you end up using them in your end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I’ll either write a new blog post on the implementation of another core system or, if I make any progress on the proof of concept for other gameplay loops, outline those, much like I did here for saving games. As usual, the development of the game has somewhat stagnated, as the book takes precedence this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, comments or feedback, feel free to reach out to me through any of the channels I make available in the About page; and if you want to give a more in-depth look to the code, you can check my github, linked in the footer. Bear in mind all of this details my journey in self-teaching both Godot and game development, so I’m sure some of the ways I handle things are not optimal. It’s part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book Update #3: Balance in the opening, and the problem with exposition]]></title><description><![CDATA[After I finished the first draft and revised five thousand words last month, I set a lofty goal for this month’s book update.

Unfortunately, things were a bit slower than I’d hoped, mainly due to certain problems that needed to be adressed in the starting chapters. The silver lining is that handling those problems allowed me to reflect on some aspects of the writing process for long enough that I can leverage them into a blog post. As always, if all you’re interested in is a word count update, feel free to jump to the end of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And the Empire was huge - the problem with exposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the first pieces of advice every writer hears multiple times throughout the course of his career is &lt;em&gt;show, don’t tell&lt;/em&gt;. This “rule” is supposed to help you with making sure your prose isn’t hard to read. Quite often, especially in fantasy, young authors start with a healthy passion for the worlds their favorite authors built, from the dizzying expansiveness of Tolkien’s mythology to the intricacies of Brandon Sanderson’s magic systems. This passion is undoubtedly beneficial, and in no small part it is why people want to write. You see those myths, those people, those worlds, and you think to yourself: “maybe I could do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, in the quest to mimic those, depth can be confused with detail. On the one hand, the depth in Tolkien’s work comes as much from the sheer quantity of backstory he wrote for that world. On the other hand, if you were to read or watch &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, you probably wouldn’t know anything about Húrin - because you don’t have to know anything about Húrin to follow the story to the fullest, and because including that whole backstory would probably have harmed the story in other ways: for instance, by affecting its pacing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of something like Brandon Sanderson’s books. The magic systems Sanderson cooks up are usually extremely detailed. Something like Allomancy has several internal rules that determine how everything functions in the internal logic of the universe. But if Sanderson started &lt;em&gt;Mistborn&lt;/em&gt; with an in-depth discussion of how Allomancy works, most readers would get bored pretty quickly. It’s hard to connect to a story unless something in it speaks to you, and the product of worldbuilding needs to be realized into avatars of sorts (characters or not) that cash in on all that work. It’s sort of like backend and frontend in software. The backend is running the show, and unless it’s well done things quite simply won’t work. But the frontend is what your users will interact with. Its quality determines how much they like your program or application, how good it feels to use. You can have the fastest backend in the world (in this analogy, this would mean Tolkien-esque worldbuilding), but if your frontend is just a console, people will choose to use prettier, snappier applications (in this analogy, the frontend would be your characters, your plot, anything you use to pass out the information to the readers in an appealing way). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my book, I have both an out of the ordinary setting, and an out of the ordinary magic system. Without getting too much into spoiler territory, the setting is one where being sad, miserable, or otherwise with a very serious case of the blues is a big no-no, bordering on a crime against the state. And the magic system that naturally follows is predicated on the concept of emotional manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a pair of ideas that is at the core of much of the conflict and themes of the book, but very hard to execute properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more alien the elements of the story are, the more explanation they need to make sure they don’t alienate the readers. Of course everyone likes originality, new settings, new concepts: but there is a balance to find in it where you have to layer the new concepts with familiarity, otherwise people will just be confused. If the characters in your story act, think, and feel nothing like the people we know and interact with, even if there’s a good logical reason for it, there’s a good chance a lot of the readers won’t be able to connect to them. And emotional connection is at the core of every good story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was revising the first couple of chapters in my book, I realized some things related to this problem needed work. I didn’t really explain at all what the magic system was about until a bit later into the chapter, and I realized it could be quite frustrating to hear all the characters talk about it without having any idea what they meant. At the same time, I had to find a way to insert some explanation as to what the magic system was. I could have sat two characters down and made one of them explain everything to the other, but that seems sloppy and not very interesting; it would have just been a proxy for me to explain things directly to the reader. Instead, I added an entirely new scene before the story starts - a prologue of sorts - that tells a self-contained, quite short story about the consequences of using this magic system and how it affects people. I tell this short story through the eyes of the main character, but years before the main story of the book begins. I feel like it does a fairly good job of illustrating the magic system, the setting it exists in, and sets up some character traits for the main character, but does so with things happening in that front, instead of just doing it through exposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this prologue was new writing altogether, so it had to go through the whole process of writing, revising, then revising again. That’s the main reason things were a bit slower with the revision than I had thought - but I’m confident the book was made better for it, which is really all that matters in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be quite interesting when I send the book to beta readers to actually see if they’re confused by what happens in the first few chapters or not, specifically when it comes to the setting and magic system. It’s hard for me to have the distance required to know whether or not things need further explanation, because I know how everything works already. It’s sort of how a power user won’t really notice that a menu is confusing, because he’s used it thousands of times before, so he knows where everything is. I’ve done my best to find a balance with this, but I won’t really know if it worked until I get other people’s opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something tells me that, like much of my writing (and my creative endeavors in general), it’ll end up being mostly an iterative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the new scene and reworking exposition in the first few chapters required some new writing that slowed down the revision process. For this reason, I didn’t meet the word count goal for this month. However, I still revised a little over ten thousand words and tightened up the beginning of the book a lot. I will carry over the same goal for the month of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current word count&lt;/strong&gt;: 16.195 thousand words (second draft).
&lt;strong&gt;July goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Go up to 35 to 40 thousand words in the second draft.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dev Diaries #3: July Update]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last month I said I was iterating on gameplay loops to try and find something that works for the game while I grind away at the book.

This month I will do my first actual implementation overview, and sort of go through the challenges of implementing the sort of 2D combat that you see traditionally in a lot of indie games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is being developed on Godot Engine, and Godot uses the concept of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/godot_design_philosophy.html&quot;&gt;scene tree.&lt;/a&gt; Understanding Godot’s design philosophy is extremely important to make sure things work properly in the end and you can assemble the different blocks in a single scene without everything being very cumbersome to change. From my understanding of it, the design rules for designing a game’s scenes are very similar to the design rules for designing, say, APIs. One of the most important questions you’ll have to answer in both is what the responsibilities are for specific classes. Generally speaking, in software, it’s a good idea to follow the &lt;em&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; (SRP). According to Wikipedia, the SRP states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module or function.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a fancy way of saying that your classes should do one thing, and one thing alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Godot, the Scene’s responsibility is that of &lt;em&gt;orchestrating&lt;/em&gt; everything else. So, for a combat scenario where you have a character fighting a monster, the character and the monster handle themselves. They know when they get hit, when they’re supposed to change their animation, and in general can behave without input from other classes. But the scene is what controls everything they don’t know themselves; for instance, the GUI, their relative positions, and whatever information they need to react to that they don’t have in their own class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s check what the composition was for the scene that I assembled containing the proof of concept for 2D combat.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see there are four main components in the scene: the player character, a monster (here represented by a nice little ghost), an obstacle in the form of a pillar, and the GUI controlling the player’s health and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping in line with what I mentioned before, let’s look at what the code looks like in the actual scene’s file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;func _ready&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	$Player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;$PlayerStartPosition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; true&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	$Mob&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;$PlayerStartPosition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	$CombatGUI&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updateHealth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	$CombatGUI&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updateStamina&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	
func _on_Mob_shoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;bullet&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; pos&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Spawns the bullet, makes it move, and rotates it to move towards the player.&lt;/span&gt;
	var b &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; bullet&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	add_child&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	var &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Vector2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;rotated&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;$Mob&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;angle_to_point&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;$Player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;global_position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pos&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

func _on_Player_update_Healthbar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;health&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	$CombatGUI&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updateHealth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;health&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three things here: first, the ready function, that starts the whole scene. It spawns the player at a particular position, does the same for the mob, and sets the GUI to show full health and stamina. The player and the mob both control their own health - it wouldn’t make any sense for the scene orchestrating them to control it. But it does make sense for the scene to orchestrate the GUI to match the player’s health, and since the player class always spawns the player at full health and stamina when instanced, we can just set the GUI to show full health and stamina. In a full production level, we could make the scene set the GUI values to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$Player.currentHealth&lt;/code&gt; instead of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second function is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;on_Mob_shoot&lt;/code&gt;. You might be wondering why spawning the bullet that the monster shoots is the responsibility of the scene, and not the responsibility of the monster. The easy reply is that the monster class doesn’t have all the information required to spawn the bullet itself. The bullet needs to be spawned pointing towards the player character’s position, and the monster has no idea what the player character’s position is. Besides, the monster has to spawn the bullet in a specific position in the actual scene, and the only class that can do that is the scene itself. If the monster is the child of the scene, and the bullet is a child of the scene too - one that will exist and behave independently of the monster - then the bullet needs to be a child of the scene as well, and not a child of the monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_on_Player_update_Healthbar&lt;/code&gt;. This function, like the last one, is a signal - meaning it triggers when something else happens that emits the signal this function is listening for. In this case, the trigger would be the player’s health updating. If the player knows that it got shot, and updates his own health accordingly, then the scene, that has control of the GUI, should make sure the GUI reflects the update in the player’s health. If we were doing stamina management as well, there should be another function listening in for when the player updates his own stamina. However, for the proof of concept, there is still no stamina management implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t give a detailed look into the Player class in this game, mainly because I feel like it deserves a blog post of its own in the future. In rough terms, the Player class takes input from the user and can move and attack. Besides that, it can take damage, and it will die if it takes too much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, however, go into a big challenge that I found when implementing the Monster class: pathfinding, or enemy AI in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pathfinding AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic behavior I wanted from the monster was that it would chase the player around and shoot it whenever it got close enough. This was mostly easy to implement, except for one thing: pathfinding. Remember the pillar in the middle of the scene? Making the monster move in a straight line towards the player was easy enough, but making the monster calculate the best possible path if the player hid behind a pillar was actually very challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get right into it. This is how things ended up looking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;

	set_process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;true&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, that’s a lot to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_process&lt;/code&gt; function. This is a function that runs on every frame that the game renders. It’s useful for things that need to constantly be recalculated, like, for instance, what the best path to take is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we do is check if the mob should be moving or not. This is a simple flag to add that can save a lot of computation later. If the mob shouldn’t be moving, there is no need to do any path calculation whatsoever, so we can make sure we’re not using any processing power doing that if the flag says it’s not needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we determine where the monster needs to move from, and where it needs to move to. It needs to go from where it currently is (that’s the start position) to where the player is at the time of the calculation (that’s the end position).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a simple animation check to deal with the sprites. If the player is to the left of the monster, we need to make sure the sprite is facing left. If the player is to the right of the monster, we need to make sure the sprite is facing right. Otherwise, the monster would look like it’s moonwalking towards the player sometimes. It’s a ghost, but it has no eyes on its back! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we jump to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;updatePath()&lt;/code&gt; function. This was the saving grace of my development process. I tried for hours to find a way to algorithmically calculate what the best way to dodge a specific obstacle would be for the monster. Among other things, I tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having collision boxes on the obstacles and the monster. When the monster met an object, it would calculate the distance it was between itself and the top and the bottom of the obstacle, then it would try to go around it through the shortest possible path. This didn’t work very well for situations where there were multiple obstacles: the monster would try to go around one, then bump into another, try to go around that one, and end up moving away from the player instead of taking a different path that was a bit longer but allowed it to actually chase its prey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having the monster hit the obstacles at a slight angle. This way, it would sort of slide off the pillar and eventually be able to move around it before continuing to chase the player in a straight line. This also didn’t work great with multiple obstacles, because then the monster could easily get stuck if there was no place it could slide to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I found out about &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_navigation2d.html&quot;&gt;Navigation2D.&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out Godot already provided the functionality of pathfinding I wanted to implement: all I needed to do was create a Navigation2D node and declare what the “walkable” area of the scene was. Any area outside that wouldn’t be considered valid for pathfinding purposes, making the monster path around it. I added a Navigation2D that excluded the pillar, and made the monster update its own path by checking that node instead of trying to calculate it programatically. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;update_path&lt;/code&gt; function then returns an array of points the monster would have to move to in sequence in order to reach the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the process function just executes on that array, by moving to each point in sequence while there are points to move to. This movement can now be in a straight line, because the points themselves will already illustrate the path that the monster needs to move around. If there aren’t any points left to move to, the monster just stops moving. There is a collision box checking when it is close enough to the player and toggling the “stop moving” flag when the monster is close enough to shoot, so the monster never actually runs out of path to follow; what happens is that when it gets close enough, it stops processing the path. When the player leaves the monster’s range, the flag gets toggled, and the monster begins processing the path again on every frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like in motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/3dbb8b42b088bd66bf123328e4eb70d4/working2DCombat.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image info&quot; title=&quot;Working POC&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were paying attention, you might have noticed the reason I had the bullets be spawned by the scene itself, instead of by the monster, is that the monster should have no idea what the relative position of the player is. But in my implementation of the moving algorithm, I use the player’s current position as the end position for the monster’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_process&lt;/code&gt; function! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be right to notice this. This is, in fact, a good indication that calculating the path should be a responsibility of the scene. Most likely, the monster should only have a function named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; that receives an array of positions, and executes on it; while calculating the content of that array of positions should be done by the scene, because it has all the information required to do so, whereas the monster shouldn’t. Imagine we wanted to spawn a monster in a scene with no player: the way things are implemented above, we’d have to create a new Monster implementation, because it would break when trying to use the player’s end position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the proof of concept, I decided not to change this, and to let it live as a reminder of how proper design often comes from iteration. If I was developing the actual end product, that would be a necessary change going forward. For now, I think it’s more important for me to start looking at other aspects of the game, and to polish the design of whatever gameplay loop I end up going with in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the assets you see in the proof of concept are free assets I’m using for mocking purposes, and they come from itch.io. You can find several free asset packs to work with there, although most of them require crediting if you end up using them in your end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I’ll either write a new blog post on the implementation of another core system or, if I make any progress on the proof of concept for other gameplay loops, outline those, much like I did here for 2D combat. As usual, the development of the game is somewhat slowed, as the book takes precedence this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, comments or feedback, feel free to reach out to me through any of the channels I make available in the About page; and if you want to give a more in-depth look to the code, you can check my github, linked in the footer. Bear in mind all of this details my journey in self-teaching both Godot and game development, so I’m sure some of the ways I handle things are not optimal. It’s part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book Update #2: Second Drafting, plot cohesion, and titles]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am glad to say I am done with the first draft of the book.

It took me longer than I expected it to (perhaps my predictions are a bit optimistic), but it is done. I am glad with what I came up with and have started a second passthrough and first revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my first draft was all about getting the story on paper and making sure I had it all vomited out, the second draft requires a bit more finesse. As I finished my first draft, I was immediately afforded with a lot of clarity. Now that I had a full, bird’s eye view of the story that I wanted to tell, it was easier to look at the individual chapters and scenes and realize things that didn’t fit or that needed to be changed. Throughout the process of writing the first draft I also kept a journal of every thing that I noticed as I went along and wanted to mark as “review this later”. This was a way to shut up my inner editor for long enough that I could actually get anything done. But now that I’m done with the first draft, it’s time to address these concerns - so, besides adjusting some plot points, I’ll also be reworking some scenes and massively improving the language, sentence construction, atmosphere… Really, everything about the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once heard a famous author (I want to say Neil Gaiman, but am not fully certain) say that the first draft was when you wrote, and the second draft was when you made it look like you had any idea what you were doing the first time around. The second draft is where the magic is going to happen, and I’m super excited to take the time to polish up my scenes and make them as good and immersive as I can. I’ve already started working on some dialogues in the first chapter and I think they’re coming out a lot better this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might have noticed is that I’ve added a tentative title of &lt;strong&gt;“The Life Collectors”&lt;/strong&gt; to the home page of the website. This is not a final title, I want to make that very clear. But I figured it was time I started thinking about it, and that it gave everything a bit more of a professional look if I removed “Untitled Book” from the homepage. Titles are hard for me to come up with, so I’m trying some and seeing how interesting they are and if any of them sticks until I’m done with the book. Maybe it’ll be “The Life Collectors”, but most likely the title will still change several times until I land on something. We’ll see on the next update, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for keeping up with what I’ve been doing, and I hope I can get my work to you soon. I can’t wait for you to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, I’m about 5 thousand words in and working on the second draft  as outlined above. Considering that I want to have this book finished this year, and that there’s still a part of the process missing involving beta readers, I’m going to kick things up to eleven and set a goal for this month of revising at least 35, but ideally 40 thousand words of the first draft. This will take a lot of time if I want to make sure that the quality remains high, but it’s a challenge I want to impose on myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current word count&lt;/strong&gt;: 5 thousand words (second draft).
&lt;strong&gt;June goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Revise 35 to 40 thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dev Diaries #2: June Update]]></title><description><![CDATA[This will unfortunately be a very short dev diary, and it’ll serve only as an update as to what’s been going on.

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in my latest Book Update, I’ve been making a lot of progress with the book and am trying to meet my personal goal of having it fully done this year. Like I said in my mission statement, the book will take precedence over the game until it is done. So, this month I got a lot of work done on the book, and not a lot of work done on the game. I started working on the proof of concept for sidescrolling combat, and implemented it (you can see it on github), but did not address any of the other possible gameplay mechanics. Hopefully I’ll be able to make some progress on at least one of them this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll make a more detailed post on implementing basic sidescrolling combat soon, but for now this is all the updates on the state of the game for the month of June. If you were more interested in the game than in the book, I’m sorry, but I’ve always made it very clear that the book is my priority for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you back again soon with more meaningful updates for the game’s development!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book Update #1: First Drafting]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve written a lot of “books”, all of them absolute garbage and nothing I want to ever see the light of day.

&lt;p&gt;Some of them were bad because I was too young to know any better. Some of them were bad because I hadn’t had enough practice to iron out some kinks in my writing. And some of them were bad because I didn’t work on them enough. Something which I’ve come to understand is that I’ve written a lot of books, but I haven’t finished a lot of them. That’s because I skipped one of the main steps: editing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone said once that editing is when you make it look like you knew what the hell you were doing when you wrote your first draft. I find that to be an accurate description. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look back at all the stuff I’ve written before, I see a lot of potential in it, but no coherent solid body of work. That’s because I didn’t take the time to edit it appropriately, to gain some distance and then look on it and try to improve it with a bird’s eye view of the entire story. I sort of just went at it and wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why with this book I’m expecting to take the rest of this year to call it “done”, even though I’m almost done with the first draft before the year reaches the halfway mark. I will then have to let it rest for a slight while, do an entire readthrough with a plot edit, then do some line editing and correct any typos or weird wordings, then send it out to beta readers and adjust according to feedback. Yes, that’s a formal outline of the steps the book will have to go through for me to consider it done. I expect to be done with all these steps this year still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a lot of the updates will simply illustrate how far along this path I am. Therefore, they’ll be quite short, unless I come up across some problem or subject I find interesting and want to talk about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these stages will also imply a lower level of involvment on my end. When that happens, I’ll take the extra time to give some of my other projects attention, like my ongoing videogame. However, to make it perfectly clear, the book will always take priority, as it is my main goal for this year. I will only look at other stuff when my input is not needed on the book or when I have extra time remaining: for instance, when I’m waiting on beta reader feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, I’m about 110.000 words in and working on the first draft of what I expect to be the last couple of chapters. I want to hopefully finish the first draft this month, although that might be a slightly ambitious goal. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current word count&lt;/strong&gt;: 103.810 words
&lt;strong&gt;Current goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Finish first draft.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dev Diaries #1: Finding a Gameplay Loop]]></title><description><![CDATA[I understand stories better than I understand game design.

&lt;p&gt;That’s the crux of current problem with developing my game. I know precisely what story I want to tell and what themes I want to approach - but any game must have a somewhat defined recurring gameplay loop which makes up for the bulk of the player’s experience. Coming up with that central gameplay loop is harder than it sounds, at least for me. In this post I’ll attempt to make clear what my thought process is on this matter, and why I don’t just slap some gameplay onto the game. I will also attempt to make this post into a decision log of sorts, where I lay out the options I’ve identified so far and their respective pros and cons. Hopefully this process will introduce some clarity, or at the very least it will serve as an historical document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to aim for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the central gameplay loop must be enjoyable. This might seem like a very obvious thing to say, but I think it’s important that this is the first consideration. Above all, players must like playing the game. I have often seen games put their intended message and artistic merit above player enjoyment. Just recently I played a very interesting narrative driven game that was riddled with issues because it just wasn’t fun to play, even though the story was very engaging. While I can’t presume to know how the development process went for that particular game, I definitely felt like they made the game serve the story they wanted to tell, and came up with something that just wasn’t enjoyable to play; or at least, not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say gameplay can’t serve the narrative. Visual novels and walking simulators, for instance, are enjoyable to the audience they target, explicitly because the gameplay, simple as it may be, serves a particular purpose to enable the narrative and experience they want to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my second point: the gameplay must be coherent with the narrative themes, and ideally enhance them. At the very least, it shouldn’t directly contradict them. &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt; would be a much worse game if, instead of a dodging game reminiscent of old SHMUP experiences, it had traditional 2D side scrolling combat. Ideally, the gameplay loop would directly tie into the narrative experience and enhance it: &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, is a game for which a brutal, opressive combat system decidedly makes sense, and enhances the brutal, opressive atmosphere of a decaying world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third point is a bit more controversial: it should be in some way new. That doesn’t mean coming up with some new way of interacting with the game entirely. New gameplay mechanics are hard to come by, and the returns on coming up with them are often diminished by the learning curve required with having to introduce players to new mechanics. Everyone can play a platformer: the collective cultural experience that everyone sort of has about video games makes a platformer very easy to understand. But that doesn’t mean you can’t improve on &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Brothers 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, a more personal point. If my central focus is narrative, I could just pick an existing gameplay loop and implement the one that better served the narrative I want to tell. And I might still do just that - but if I do, I personally want to iterate on it in some way. Game development is not only a narrative process in artistic terms, but also a creative process in terms of the actual game aspect of it. I don’t think I’d be happy with my game if I didn’t try to improve upon whichever gameplay loop I end up choosing, even if it’s just a small incremental improvement. I strongly believe in iteration: even mechanics as simple as those found in walking simulators can be improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up, here’s what I’m looking for in terms of the main gameplay loop is:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ol style=&quot;padding-left:30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An enjoyable gameplay loop that...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;... Does not directy contradict, and ideally enhances the narrative experience, while...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;... Improving upon at least some of the existing implementations of similar gameplay loops. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s go through each gameplay loop I think is available to me and try to figure out some pros and cons for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Card Game or Card / Puzzle Game Hybrid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering I was once a professional card game player, designing a card game would probably be my first instinct. It’s a subject I know very well, it’s something I can be reasonably creative in, while not feeling completely out of my depth. It’s also something that would not be tremendously hard to implement on the tech side. Like with sidescrolling combat, the hardest thing to implement would almost surely be enemy AI, but even then there are excellent resources available on how to implement card game enemy AI: &lt;em&gt;Prismata&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, has done excellent work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a card game is generally not suited to single-player narrative driven experiences, considering how dependent the genre is on stuff like evolving metas and deckbuilding capabilities. Fortunately, games like &lt;em&gt;Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales&lt;/em&gt; have already introduced a puzzle / card game hybrid that maintains some of the best things about card games (the puzzles, trying to decide what the correct play at any given time is) that works well for single-player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see two cons to this main gameplay loop. First of all is that it doesn’t seem to serve the narrative in any way. The game is broadly about corruption vs kindness, and how people react in desperate situations. To do it with a card game would imply finding a way to make the gameplay play to those themes. While possible, this isn’t immediately easy or obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second con is the art expense. Card games in general have excellent art. &lt;em&gt;Magic The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;’s art is legendary, &lt;em&gt;Gwent&lt;/em&gt; had extremely high quality art, and in general the card game audience has very high expectations in what concerns the quality of their card art. This would make it hard to meet those expectations with my available funds: after all, top tier artists are expensive, a card game demands a very high quantity of good art, and this is an indie, hobby level project. The investment would not just be hard to justify, but hard to make happen in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking Simulator / Visual Novel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one wants to make a game and call it narrative-driven, there is always the question of whether or not to make it limited in actual gameplay mechanics, and make it instead a visual novel or a walking simulator. Those games are, in fact, often associated with a heavier focus on narrative, because there are no other mechanics in it to compete with the story: the game lives and dies on its plot and characters. I include in this section games that have very limited gameplay mechanics, like &lt;em&gt;To The Moon&lt;/em&gt;, which I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest con for this type of approach is the “enjoyable” bullet point. A lot of people just don’t like visual novels. Walking simulators are a polarizing genre, with people often arguing they’re not even games. If I wanted to maximize the audience I can reach, perhaps walking simulators and visual novels needlessly restrict me from the getgo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don’t think making decisions based on whether or not something is too niche is particularly productive, especially because I’m someone trying to develop a game I’m proud of, and not a mega-corporation trying to maximize profits. Because of that, the central question is just whether or not I’d be happy making a walking sim or a visual novel. They tend to be less challenging on the technical aspect than other games, and while I coded systems like saved games myself (instead of using engines like Ren’Py), I feel like I’d still have to find ways to challenge myself with new features and ways to iterate on the visual novel / walking sim formula to be happy with the end product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Platformer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t particularly enjoy platformers, so it’s easy for me to dismiss this option, as I want to work on something I’m personally engaged by. However, for the sake of the exercise, I’ll still go through the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platformers are easy to iterate on and there’s tons of stuff I could introduce to try and make the experience varied and unique. They also have a very large amount of data available on how to code different aspects, available from different games and their tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the con side, they’re probably the most overcrowded genre on the indie market right now. Everyone makes platformers, and lots of players aren’t willing to give yet another new platformer a try. They want something new. If I wanted to make a platformer, I’d have to find a differentiating factor, like &lt;em&gt;Ori and the Blind Forest&lt;/em&gt; did with its artstyle. But it would have to come from the mechanics side of it, as I would never have the budget to throw at the game to make it stand out on its art alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2D Roguelike Combat: Either Side-scrolling or Top-Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my initial instinct when starting the development process. It just felt natural to me, and I feel like that comes from an inclination that I have from my playing experiences: that having bad guys you fight with several different tools is the basic gameplay loop mostly everyone is familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some downsides, however. The technical aspect of coding combat can be seen as a boon and a challenge. It took me almost a month to code a basic enemy AI that just chases the player character around shooting stuff at him when it gets within a certain range. This is a very slow pace, and combat AI is something it’d take me a long time to learn and code, probably. I’ve looked into how games like Rimworld and Left 4 Dead 2 do their AIs, and there’s a lot to unpack there. But even though it might be biting off more than I can chew, I also can’t help but feel excited by it. It’s an interesting subject, and one I’d like to try and tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest downside besides that is the animation cost. Whereas other genres would have limited costs in terms of walking / jumping animations for the characters and then punctual cost for special animations as needed, a combat-heavy game would have exponentially higher cost: animations for every mob, their different moves, the player character’s different moves, potential new weapons… All of this would have to be purchased, or I’d have to learn to draw it myself. Either way this would mean a large increase in the development cost for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that I’ve listed the options… What comes next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next month, and until it is done, my priority will be the book I’ve been working on for the last year. That means that, when my time is limited and I have to choose, I’ll work on the book first, and only give the game my full attention when the book is done. The reason I say this is that I’m fully aware that I might not finish what I’m about to propose in time, and that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next steps will be building a Proof of Concept for each of the gamemodes above, and try and see how I’d implement them in a scene. In that scene, focus on how I’d try and answer some of the questions I asked myself here, like the questions about differentiation for some of the genres. With the working POCs in hand I’ll be able to make a more informed decision on which path to take for the entire game. Perhaps I’ll even find a compromise and use bits and pieces of them. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s the deliverable for the next dev diary: I’ll report back on how the development is going for the different POCs, with the forewarning that they’ll be on the back burner until I’m done with the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mission Statement: This blog, the website, and more.]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 2013, I went to college.

I didn’t really know what I wanted to go to college for, and I ended up choosing Philosophy as a major because I thought it would give me a broad spectrum of skills and sort of postpone the actual decision of what I wanted to do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophy is a great major. I’m very grateful for the things that I learned during my time studying it, and I wish the state of humanities’ academia in Portugal wasn’t such that even the most skilled of students have no place at universities and aren’t particularly valued by the private sector. But that was the case, and I soon realized that I would have a very hard time finding a job related to my studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not, however, someone who likes to wait idly for things to get better. So I tried to figure out how I could leverage my work and the things that I liked into a proper career. At first that meant getting a Master’s in American Literature and American Culture. I thought I could at least get a job as a translator while I looked for something better, and surely a Master’s degree completed with honors would mean something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I could give academia a real try, I realized what I was actually passionate about. In my Philosophy B.A., I specialized in Logics. In my Master’s, I gave special emphasis to American Literature. What do those have in common, and what do they have in common with what I ended up doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I came to was that what I really liked was stories; and that I wanted to do something related to them in some way, shape or faction. But I also found that working as a literature analyst was in a way oppressive. I missed seeing the real impact of the things I was doing, and it can be hard at times with literature to be sure what you do matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I started coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My skills in Logics, that I’d gotten during my BA, helped me a lot with getting into code. I did a bootcamp, I practiced a lot, and I found out that not only was I good at it and enjoyed the puzzle solving, as well as the fact that my code’s impact in the world was often clear and measurable, writing code was actually quite a bit like storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coding as Storytelling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote and, especially, read more code, I realized a great part of the problems in programming came down to mistakes in communication, ambiguities that weren’t properly removed, things being overly verbose, or problems in a similar vein. Most production level systems ran by competent teams don’t really have critical level bugs that are caused by a massive oversight in logics, or someone entirely missing the logical foundation for a problem. Processes like code reviews, thorough testing habits, and general good practices do a good job of curbing those. Yet the problems I found the most often were the ones that eluded code reviews, because people no longer paid attention to them; the ones that got through testing, because it wasn’t clear what the test was doing, and we thought that a condition was being tested when it wasn’t; or the ones that don’t trigger the alarms because people simply don’t notice them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code must be readable. Not just to save the time of developers that come after and try to read it, but because if it isn’t, they won’t read it properly. And that will invariably lead to lost time, money, mental health, and generally a bunch of really avoidable problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s generally not very controversial to say that code must be readable, and I’m glad that’s the case - even though executing on this principle is often harder than naming it. But I think we should go a step further, and say not just that code must be readable: it must be &lt;em&gt;engaging&lt;/em&gt;. People pay more attention to books they find interesting. People pay more attention to code they’re engaged by. If your code is readable, but not particularly engaging, you run the risk of people’s mind drifting, and them missing something important in your code. When I started coding after years of researching literature, I tried to apply several principles of how you make a good story to how I write my code - to generally good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the following code I wrote for one of my games to handle an enemy’s movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;func _process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; mobHealth &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
		queue_free&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; stopMoving&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
		&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	startPosition &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; position
	endPosition &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
		$ProperAnimation&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;flip_h &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; true&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
		$ProperAnimation&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;flip_h &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; false&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	_update_path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

			path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way you declutter the actual method that’s telling the story - and whoever’s invested in it enough to want to get into the nitty gritty, instead of just getting an idea of how the system works, can go to the secondary method ´moveThroughPath´ and find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t revolutionary. Lots of very well established names in programming advocate for similar results through other names - for instance, Robert C. Martin’s &lt;em&gt;Clean Code&lt;/em&gt; argues in favor of a similar extraction on the basis that functions should have a single responsibility, and orchestration is already a responsibility. If you follow that rule, you generally get similar results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I haven’t often seen it formulated in terms of storytelling. Perhaps because it’s less useful to people that don’t have my background or a similar interest in stories. For me, it helps to think of code that way. You wouldn’t want a novel to suddenly stop the thread of the main intrigue in its path to tell you about how the main character’s sword was made. So why should code break the narrative flow in such a way? Thinking of code in this way has allowed me to translate a lot of my skills in other areas to the activity of writing code. Of course, there’s more that I use in my day to day - I have a deep understanding of complex logics which helps with the algorithmic aspects of code, and the communication and speech skills acquired by reading, presenting at conferences, etc have a real practical application in the software world, where you must and should still interact effectively with people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mission statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the above, the mission statement shouldn’t come as a surprise. I want to write good stories. I want to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; good stories. Stories are fundamentally a way to connect with other people, and I believe code acts as a facilitator for precisely that. Good code lets people connect, be it by enabling thriving businesses or by letting developers separated by time, different backgrounds and different interests to read code they didn’t write, add to it, and build something together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I’ve forgotten stories themselves. As much as I love coding, I also like writing. And I want to connect with people in ways that are meaningful to me, and in ways that people have connected with me and impacted me before. That’s why I also write actual novels and short stories, and why I take an active interest in game development as a medium for telling stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post about writing, software engineering, game development, and general life. This will function as my personal hub on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories are my passion. You can explore mine in this website. I look forward to connecting with you! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
