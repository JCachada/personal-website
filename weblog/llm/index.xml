      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of discourse lately about LLMs and how useful they are. I&amp;rsquo;ve said before that I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of LLMs and I have a lot of conceptual problems, that range anywhere from &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s horrible for the climate and a violation of copyright&amp;rdquo;, to &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s another step in the Big Tech oligarchy taking over every aspect of our lives and making them measurably worse&amp;rdquo;. Those things worry me a lot still, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a clever solution to them.</description>

      <description>Two days ago, Github&amp;rsquo;s CEO Thomas Dohmke added his voice to the many that came before to say:&#xA;Either you have to embrace the Al, or you get out of your career. 1&#xA;This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this kind of discourse, usually from people who haven&amp;rsquo;t done a day of software engineering in their life. And I hate it. So this post is about why it&amp;rsquo;s silly, why they&amp;rsquo;re wrong to address you in these terms and why, if you&amp;rsquo;re a developer in the software field, you have a little bit less reason to worry than they&amp;rsquo;d like you to think.</description>
