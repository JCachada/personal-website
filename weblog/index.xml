      <description>It was raining outside, and my whole life had come undone. I was 24, and we were in the middle of a pandemic. My stepdad, who had been depressed for years (a mix of chronic back pain and midlife crisis), had finally snapped. He had been emotionally abusive for a long time, choosing me as the target of his frustrations, but today things had come to a head. Yelling that I&amp;rsquo;d closed a door too hard, he chased me around the home with bloodshot eyes, yelling that he would kill me if I ever did something like that in his home again.</description>

      <description>Two days ago, Github&amp;rsquo;s CEO Thomas Dohmke added his voice to the many that came before to say:&#xA;Either you have to embrace the Al, or you get out of your career. 1&#xA;This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this kind of discourse, usually from people who haven&amp;rsquo;t done a day of software engineering in their life. And I hate it. So this post is about why it&amp;rsquo;s silly, why they&amp;rsquo;re wrong to address you in these terms and why, if you&amp;rsquo;re a developer in the software field, you have a little bit less reason to worry than they&amp;rsquo;d like you to think.</description>

      <description>This is a short and sweet post. I am looking for people interested in beta-reading my debut novel. Having a good group of beta-readers will allow me to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s as good as it can be before I send it to editors.&#xA;You can get more information and sign up to be a beta reader here (beta reading signup is now closed.)&#xA;I look forward to hearing from you.</description>

      <title>Why This Blog Exists</title>

      <description>Back in 2020, when I was trying to make the best of my career in tech, I built myself a website using a technology called GatsbyJS. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly well designed, but I did it from scratch, and I was proud of how it turned out. You can still look at the code for it here. 1&#xA;I had plans to use that website as a showcase for myself. I shared my résumé there.</description>

      <title>2022 Book Recommendation List</title>
      <link>https://jcachada.dev/weblog/2022-reading-list/</link>

      <description>I get asked for book recommendations a lot, mostly by friends of mine who know I spend an inordinate amount of time reading. This year, I thought it would be nice to have a centralized place I could point people to. I would also like to take this as an opportunity to reflect on this year&amp;rsquo;s readings and collate my thoughts on the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to come back to them years later and notice how your thoughts on books evolve with your aging and shifts in perception - this way I&amp;rsquo;ll have a snapshot of what I thought of them when I first read them, which will be like a brain photograph when I&amp;rsquo;ve well forgotten what I read this year.</description>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 Review: Do nomads dream of organic hearts?</title>
      <link>https://jcachada.dev/weblog/cyberpunk-2077-review/</link>

      <description>A few words on the buzz This is sort of an editorial note. Please skip it if you just want the review.&#xA;Cyberpunk 2077 is, as of the date of writing this, the first single-player game to reach 1 million concurrent players on Steam, as well as the first game to ever get that achievement on the same day it got released. It is, by and large, the biggest single-player game in Steam history to date, and that’s not even counting consoles, GOG, and the Epic Games Store.</description>
