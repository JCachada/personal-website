      <description>This is a short and sweet post. I am looking for people interested in beta-reading my debut novel. Having a good group of beta-readers will allow me to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s as good as it can be before I send it to editors.
You can get more information and sign up to be a beta reader here (beta reading signup is now closed.)
I look forward to hearing from you.</description>

      <title>Why This Blog Exists</title>

      <description>Back in 2020, when I was trying to make the best of my career in tech, I built myself a website using a technology called GatsbyJS. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly well designed, but I did it from scratch, and I was proud of how it turned out. You can still look at the code for it here. 1
I had plans to use that website as a showcase for myself. I shared my r√©sum√© there.</description>

      <title>2022 Book Recommendation List</title>

      <description>I get asked for book recommendations a lot, mostly by friends of mine who know I spend an inordinate amount of time reading. This year, I thought it would be nice to have a centralized place I could point people to. I would also like to take this as an opportunity to reflect on this year&amp;rsquo;s readings and collate my thoughts on the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to come back to them years later and notice how your thoughts on books evolve with your aging and shifts in perception - this way I&amp;rsquo;ll have a snapshot of what I thought of them when I first read them, which will be like a brain photograph when I&amp;rsquo;ve well forgotten what I read this year.</description>
