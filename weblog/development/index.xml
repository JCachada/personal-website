      <description>Two days ago, Github&amp;rsquo;s CEO Thomas Dohmke added his voice to the many that came before to say:&#xA;Either you have to embrace the Al, or you get out of your career. 1&#xA;This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this kind of discourse, usually from people who haven&amp;rsquo;t done a day of software engineering in their life. And I hate it. So this post is about why it&amp;rsquo;s silly, why they&amp;rsquo;re wrong to address you in these terms and why, if you&amp;rsquo;re a developer in the software field, you have a little bit less reason to worry than they&amp;rsquo;d like you to think.</description>

      <description>Back in 2020, when I was trying to make the best of my career in tech, I built myself a website using a technology called GatsbyJS. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly well designed, but I did it from scratch, and I was proud of how it turned out. You can still look at the code for it here. 1&#xA;I had plans to use that website as a showcase for myself. I shared my résumé there.</description>
