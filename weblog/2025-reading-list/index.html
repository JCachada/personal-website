<content>
  <p><strong>Please note</strong>: These are my thoughts on the books at the time that I read them and wrote about it. My opinions change with time, with experience, etc. These are not gospel on what I think of a book - they are snapshots of a particular time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2025BookList.png" alt="2025 Book List Screencap"></p>
<p>Note: Collage made with <a href="https://sudwald.github.io/bookcollage/">https://sudwald.github.io/bookcollage/</a>. Thank you to Sammy for the great tool.</p>
<p>The image is not ordered by any particular rating system. I will, however, share with you what I rated each book as. First, a quick explanation of my rating system - I use a 5-star rating system, where the different scores mean the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5 stars: these are the books that have not only taught me something, but that I feel like I will remember in ten years. I would wholeheartedly recommend books in this category to anyone who asks. If I had to build a library with the different books I&rsquo;ve read over the years, the 5-star category of every year is what would populate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 stars: these are books that I thoroughly enjoyed reading and that I thought were above average, but that don&rsquo;t quite make the cut of five-stardom. For instance, an otherwise excellent book with an unsatisfying ending would fit here; or an excellent, rompy ride where I think the prose isn&rsquo;t anything to write home about. I would still recommend books in this tier to people most of the time, but I would consider them less essential reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 stars: these are the books that I thought were pretty okay. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with them, and most of them do more than a couple of things right, but when it comes down to it they&rsquo;re not books I think I will remember for a long time. To think of them as the airport reads of this list might be a bit too harsh of a description, but the mind wanders in that direction. Think of the books in this section as perfectly okay, but with nothing that made me want to rave about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 stars: these are books that I don&rsquo;t regret reading, but would not read again and don&rsquo;t particularly recommend. They usually have more than one trait that bothered me and, overall, took some degree of forcing myself to continue reading in order to finish them. That isn&rsquo;t necessarily to say the books are awful or not worth reading - just that I did not enjoy them for one reason or another (I will do my best to expand on why).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 star: these are books that I had no fun reading, learned nothing from, and regret spending time with. It&rsquo;s relatively rare for books to land themselves in this category, and I try to find redeeming qualities in most of the things I read, but sometimes I just think books are genuinely dreadful.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A note of appreciation</strong></p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s list owes a big debt to the public library branch of Scotland, Ontario. I wandered in there for a lovely afternoon while visiting Canada, and browsed their very well organized shelves to find a lot of the books in this list. I have marked the ones found there with a 🇨🇦 (even if the author is not Canadian).</p>
<p>The public library was one of my favorite parts of that trip, and included so many public services, resources, and uplifting things in just the one afternoon I spent there. I saw them setting up a 3D Printer and going over what things they could let patrons print (yes to tools, no to guns, even if they&rsquo;re pretend). I saw people coming in to get help with their computer problems. I saw people coming in to get a DVD checked out. And books, so many books.</p>
<p>Public libraries make the world a better place wherever they exist, and are a bastion of light in sometimes dark times. Please support them when you can.</p>

<h4 id="lesser-known-monsters-of-the-21st-century-by-kim-fu">Lesser Known Monsters of the 21st Century, by Kim Fu</h4>
<p>This book was a very pleasant surprise. I picked it up just because I thought the title was interesting, and the cover was gorgeous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collection of short stories ranging from the eerie slice of life to the actual horror; and it was, in a lot of ways, the most creative horror book I&rsquo;ve read in a long time. The vast majority of the stories are refreshing and nothing I had particularly met before, and even the more familiar ones (like one about Time Cubes, a structure that allows people to get aged or made younger when they&rsquo;re inside it) played with the ideas in novel ways. Fu&rsquo;s writing is contemplative but never too purple, and it made me stop to appreciate the sentence construction more than once. There&rsquo;s stuff like a lovely story about people all over the world losing their sense of taste out of nowhere, and the consequences that has for the world. My personal favorite was a story about Junebugs.</p>
<p>If you like the eerie in any fashion, go read this book.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="tiny-experiments-by-anne-laure-le-cunff">Tiny Experiments, by Anne-Laure Le Cunff</h4>
<p>I think this one might be quite personal. I&rsquo;m a perfectionist that struggles with frequent negative self talk, and goal-driven obsession. This book was written for me - I am the target audience, the target audience is I. Much like <em>Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, And Other Lessons from the Crematorium</em> by Caitlin Doughty felt like it had been written for the part of me filled with death anxiety, this felt like it had been written for the part of me filled with, well, everything else.</p>
<p>I got so many interesting ideas from it, perhaps the most impactful so far the notion that procrastination is a warning sign about something, and that experimentation is a privilege, not a burden.</p>
<p>I have two things to point out about this book that are not simply praise: one, it is for privileged people. If you are struggling to make ends meet, you do not have much room to make experiments. If, like me, you live under the privilege of having that space, then you can get something from it. I think <em>most</em> people could find some value in it, but it does sometimes come across as written for middle aged, upper-middle class people going through a crisis with money in the bank.</p>
<p>Two, sometimes it slips on the examples. As a lot of self help does, it started to lose me when it started trying to give examples of tech bros and their hordes as success stories for some of the principles applied. The principles are solid, the people used to defend them are sometimes not. Do try to ignore the kind of people that sometimes gets name dropped.</p>
<p>However, I got so much out of this book that I am sure I am going to use for years, and I&rsquo;m still just scraping the surface. If you struggle at all with perfectionism, burnout, being goal obsessed and feeling trapped by your own competence while you try to find purpose, I urge you to read this.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="abaddons-gate-by-james-sa-corey">Abaddon&rsquo;s Gate, by James S.A. Corey</h4>
<p>Abaddon&rsquo;s Gate* is the third book in the <em>The Expanse</em> series, a series I&rsquo;ve mostly ranked in the 3 stars so far. <strong>Obviously, this contains spoilers for the previous books of The Expanse, as well as the show.</strong></p>
<p>This one, I think, is the best book yet, for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of my main problems with the series was that I just did not find the shift to the protomolecule as the central conflict very interesting. I was really enjoying the political intrigue between Mars, Earth and the Belt, but things got less interesting when it became all about Space Zombies. In this book, it got better again - an Eldritch horror race that spans galaxies and was creating the protomolecule as just one of many tools, while trying to handle an infection that wiped them out, is far more interesting to me than space zombies. So they got me back on board with the central conflict here.</li>
<li>Two, Holden has always been a massive issue for me - he is sanctimonious, self righteous, holier than thou, and while a lot of his arc is aware of this and tries to paint him as growing out of this, it is still frankly annoying to read. My enjoyment of the series has often been inversely proportional to how much page time Holden has. In this book, Holden is finally punished for his sanctimonious character, in believable ways that make a degree of sense. That made him much more bearable; plus, his arc has progressed long enough that he is no longer as insufferable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anna was still very frustrating to read, her disconnection to the practical realities of the world never really getting punished (in fact, even getting rewarded by the end - think the Batman lecturing you on how violence isn&rsquo;t the answer, and ignoring the fact that all of this could have been avoided if he&rsquo;d just put a bullet in the Joker&rsquo;s head much sooner). This is particularly bothersome in a world that brands itself as hard sci-fi, making me feel like the authors simply did not know how to deal with this character elegantly and hoped readers wouldn&rsquo;t ask the moral question that begs to be asked.</p>
<p>On top of it, there are some small inconsistencies - it is not particularly believable to me that Ashford&rsquo;s grunts could use Martian recon armor to any degree of effectiveness that fast, after we&rsquo;ve seen Bobbie&rsquo;s perspective chapters in the previous book and seen how much training she had to go through to become effective with it. Plus, it&rsquo;s silly to me that none of the Martian trained soldiers went back to try and grab one of those armors.</p>
<p>But all in all, the book moves at breakneck speed and is always very engaging. It had me on the edge of my seat for a long time, played the cliffhangers masterfully, and maintained a very solid pace. Since it addressed my main two gripes with the series in some way, it&rsquo;s easy to ignore some of those downsides - it is still not a brilliant book, but it is about as good as it gets in terms of Hollywood-esque, blockbuster thrillers.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="careless-people-by-sarah-wynn-williams">Careless People, by Sarah Wynn-Williams</h4>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t need a lot of reasons to hate Meta more than I do. Facebook is a blight on the world, as is most of Big Tech.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on the fence, this is a great exposé from someone who was actually <em>at</em> Facebook for a long period before it became the juggernaut today. Not only that, but leading the policy team, this former New Zealand diplomat had a lot of unique access into the higher ups on Facebook, and tells you a lot about how they actually function. From damning sexual harassment crossing into sexual assault, to labor violations and overall lack of ethics, she puts the specific situations to the vague sliminess you know exists at Facebook (if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention at all), and goes even farther to name its root causes: Mark Zuckerberg and his army of higher up sycophants.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t need any more fuel to hate Meta, it will at least validate some of the beliefs you already hold with specific situations, so you can understand the evil not just at the abstract level. Plus, they don&rsquo;t want you to read this book. Facebook worked very hard to stop it from being promoted, and tried to stop it from reaching the presses at all. That alone justifies reading it.</p>
<p>My favorite bit: when Mark Zuckerberg, man-child that he is, can&rsquo;t handle losing a board game and immediately accuses his opponents of cheating when they beat him. What a loser.</p>
<p>A dreadful bit, but important: how Zuckerberg, when told in excruciating detail how he has helped Trump win 2016, skips feeling any sort of remorse and goes right to &ldquo;if we have that power, can I make myself president&rdquo;? Rot stain of a human being.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand why I hate Facebook as much as I do, hopefully this book will teach you. It is not revolutionary, and it didn&rsquo;t teach me anything I didn&rsquo;t know, but it is  important, and you should have it in your arsenal.

<h4 id="crow-talk-by-eileen-garvin">Crow Talk, by Eileen Garvin</h4>
<p>It has a very slow start and I found myself getting bored of it often in the first third. However, it does pick up the pace accordingly once the characters are established enough - specifically once Frankie and Anne both arrive at Beauty Bay.</p>
<p>Frankie&rsquo;s awkwardness borders on neurodivergence, and Aiden, Anne&rsquo;s son, is very clearly autistic from the start, hundreds of pages before the reveal. But while the book centers on Aiden&rsquo;s predicament as the axis around which everything else revolves, I found myself far more interested in Frankie and Anne&rsquo;s stories. Anne&rsquo;s is one of grief and of trying to navigate the parenthood side of a difficult life; her relationship with her husband under strain, and her best friend recently dead, she needs to balance the genuine love for her family with the circumstances she finds herself in. At one point considering divorce, to the point of planning to file the papers because of disagreements on parenting style, I found Anne to be very compelling - and her relationship with Tim to be a very nice representation of how incompatibility can creep in, even into relationships filled with genuine love.</p>
<p>As for Frankie, while I initially found her pretty uninteresting and I find the central conflict of academia she goes through pretty ridiculous (yes, <em>of course</em> this will be solved by enlisting other professors and making noise about it, how in the world did you not think of that as an option and thought you would just take it in silence?), the B plot of her father&rsquo;s struggle with alcoholism, Frankie&rsquo;s own struggles with it, and what it did to the family, brought me right back in.</p>
<p>The book ended up being compelling and enjoyable, and hooked me completely. If I had to point out two flaws, I would say: in a way, a couple of the central conflicts are handled quite lightly (Aiden&rsquo;s problem resolves itself almost spontaneously, and Frankie&rsquo;s alcoholism resolves itself by her deciding not to drink), although the lead up to those points is not particularly unbelievable. The second note would be the space that it takes for these things to happen; Frankie and Anne both take a holiday in Beauty Bay to rediscover their purpose and find direction in their life, and I can&rsquo;t help but feel a note of bitterness at it, because it comes from a place of deep privilege; most people aren&rsquo;t as rich as Anne or have a family cottage in a beautiful lake like Frankie that they can take a break in, and I surely don&rsquo;t, so Frankie&rsquo;s poverty in particular seemed almost performative with how many support structures they have around them, enabling the journey of self discovery. But I do acknowledge that people like this do exist, with those support structures in place, and that it is important to enable the story being told, so it&rsquo;s more of an expression of why I felt a bit of sour grapes towards them, more than a genuine criticism of the novel.</p>
<p>I ended up staying up until 6 am to finish the book, something which hadn&rsquo;t happened to me in a long while.</p>

<h4 id="distress-by-greg-egan">Distress, by Greg Egan</h4>
<p>Distress is like Snow Crash, by Neil Stephenson, but better.</p>
<p>Trying to explain it is wild, and when I tried to explain it to my partner I felt like a rambling maniac, so bear with me. It is a book built around the idea that the informational world is a close mirror of the physical world, and information behaves with physicality. From that idea, it spins out that just like there was a Big Bang, a point of creation of the universe in the physical realm, there will also be an Aleph moment, the point of informational creation. This Aleph moment is what the central plot of the book revolves around, with the title coming from a disease that comes from trying to contend with that informational coming of age. That&rsquo;s about all I can say without massively spoiling the book for you, and it is already verging on the edge of too much.</p>
<p>It is a tremendously creative book written by a writer who is very competent with language. Greg Egan is less flippant than Neil Stephenson by a lot, which is a style that resonates more with me. The future he thinks up is not that far from Stephenson&rsquo;s - while there is no reference to corporate owned fiefdoms and mobster-run pizza parlors, there are instead companies who have created advanced gene-targeting medicine that only the richest have access to, idealists attempting to engineer themselves out of their own humanity, and entire islands built by anarchists to try to escape the corporate rule of EnGeneUity (a name so on the nose it made me scoff).</p>
<p>The great part of Egan&rsquo;s book is just how honestly he approaches a lot of very interesting concepts. A conversation with something called a <em>Voluntary Autist</em> has him arguing that human connection is a construct built by people so that they are able to function, and that people should have the moral right to surgically remove the part of their brain that yearns for it. The ignorance cults exist, with <em>Humble Science</em> arguing that science is all good and great, up to an arbitrary point, decided by them, at which humanity should just <em>stop</em>, and avoid learning any more, so that it does not have to grapple with anything beyond its comprehension. <em>Mystical Renaissance</em> argues for the inherent beauty of the unknown and the inability of pure physicality to capture all the answers. And the Anthrocosmologists, who believe something even wilder - I&rsquo;ll leave it for you to figure out what. All of these ideas are not just wildly creative, but well explored, to a degree of plausibility that shows care, consistent with Egan taking the train of thought to its final conclusions.</p>
<p>It is, quite simply, one of the most novel and ambitious sci-fi novels I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Where it falters is in two things: one, Egan is a mathematician by trade, and sometimes he goes far too much into the technical. Trying to actually <em>explain</em> the mechanisms of ten dimensional thinking might be interesting to him, but it is not particularly relevant to the story, and all it managed to do was frustrate me. The book is dense enough as it is, what with its ideas being so hard to convey - it does not benefit at all from Egan&rsquo;s tendency to indulge his own scientific explanations, when a simple &ldquo;it&rsquo;s complicated and here&rsquo;s the one line that summarizes it&rdquo; would do it. I am not one for arguing for anti-intellectualism, but I am also not one for turning a narrative into a textbook, and Egan crosses that line a couple of times. Suffice it to say I could never read two Egan books back to back.</p>
<p>Two, Egan is either a very strong believer in the metaphysics that everything is physical and borne of the physical realm (and the things that cannot be yet explained by physics are simply &ldquo;not quite there yet&rdquo;), or he is consciously taking that stance in this book for the purpose of the thought experiment. If you are less physically minded or enjoy metaphysics that don&rsquo;t explain all aspects of phenomenology as chemistry, and all mysteries of the universe as physics, you will find yourself aligning more with the cults of ignorance than with Egan&rsquo;s protagonist. While this is an interesting experience, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me like it&rsquo;s the one Egan was aiming for - he uses words for people moving away from the cults such as &ldquo;shedding away the veil&rdquo;, and seems to take the physical nature of everything not just as the central concept around which the story is built, but also something somewhat desirable and natural. To some, it will come across as dystopia instead.</p>
<p>Still, those should not keep you away from the book; it is a unique experience.</p>

<h4 id="roadwork-by-stephen-king">Roadwork, by Stephen King</h4>
<p>My saga with reading Stephen King&rsquo;s massive body of work continues.</p>
<p>King thinks of his Bachman novels as his &ldquo;pessimistic&rdquo; ones, the ones he writes on rainy days when he&rsquo;s feeling gloomy. I have also read somewhere that King considers this his favorite Bachman novel, and that he wrote it when he was trying to make sense of his mother dying of cancer.</p>
<p>I agree with him that it is one of the better works that I&rsquo;ve read out of him. It&rsquo;s surprisingly current in the senselessness of the normal career path that it lays out, and Barton George Dawes is one of the most interesting and well written protagonists King has written so far. The story does not ever lag or outstay its welcome, and the book itself feels like reading about a train wreck that you know is coming, but cannot look away from.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much else to say about this one - it&rsquo;s King being competent and showcasing how a common man can unravel when the circumstances line up to cause it. Olivia is a particular highlight of the book and what immediately comes to mind when I think of it, as well as Mangione (the gangster with a heart), and Barton George Dawes&rsquo;s interaction with Ordner as a representative of corporate America. That last one in particular could be transposed to present day without changing much and it would still make a lot of sense.  Barton&rsquo;s relationship with his wife was not particularly novel, but it was well written and well representative of the attitude of the time towards marriage.</p>

<h4 id="the-library-book-by-susan-orlean">The Library Book, by Susan Orlean</h4>
<p>The book follows the story of the LA library fire in 1986 and the surrounding investigation, through decades of library history. In the process of doing so, it lingers on every aspect of the library&rsquo;s life - it tells the life story of many of the head librarians, it tells stories about the day to day of the library (like the phone lines serving as a proto-search engine, and the pervasive sexism pushing out people like Mary Jones), and the stories of the communities surrounding those libraries.</p>
<p>It is equal parts history book, true crime investigation, and slice of life. It is effectively what What We Talk About When We Talk About Books, by Leah Price fails to be - human. It is not dreary, it is not pretentious, and it focuses on the things that are truly important in the love of books - the human. Even when talking about the physical artifacts, like the buildings and the books themselves, they are always framed as valuable in relation to the people involved with them, and not as purely having artifact value, which was part of the problem I had with Leah Price&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>It drips with love and reverence for books and it convinced me that librarians are superheroes. It also reinforced my love of public libraries as community centers. How fitting that I got it in a small town library in Scotland, Ontario.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-message-by-ta-nehisi-coates">The Message, by Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>
<p>This was a book that I read after seeing an interview by Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author, in <em>Good Morning, America</em> . The journalist interviewing him was very hostile and Coates dealt with the questions with great grace and a deep understanding of the subject matter he was talking about.</p>
<p>The book is split off into two major sections; in one, the author visits Africa for the first time, looking for some mythical source of his blackness, some center of race identity, and then attempts to make sense of it in relation to the racial identity of black people in America.</p>
<p>This section is full of interesting thoughts about the nature of stories we tell ourselves, and about the idea of a racial identity and how it informs the lived experience of the author. As someone whose race identity has always been the prevailing one, it was deeply interesting to read about how he experiences the world, and he has a poignant, well worked prose with more than a little technical skill. It&rsquo;s a meta-story, ultimately about the nature of stories.</p>
<p>The second section is about the author&rsquo;s visit to Palestine and its relationship with the currently ongoing Palestine / Israel conflict. Namely, the author explains how he understood the Israeli state as perpetrators of genocide, and how a society of people built on the identity of victims like the Jewish people of Israel, can then work up a story to make themselves the aggressor.</p>
<p>It is a thought provoking take.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that the author muddies the lines a little bit too much in the second part of the book, and places a lot of the great rational arguments under a veneer of moral outrage that I understand and empathize with, but think weakens the argument.</p>
<p>And while I understand the reason why the author did not give &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; a platform, I also wished for this to be a more balanced take, a take that considered the geopolitical context and gave me more information as a whole. I wanted the same conclusions, defended rationally; not from a position of emotional self evidence.</p>
<p>For all that I agreed with Coates&rsquo; arguments, I did not learn much about geopolitics here. The appeals to humanity were poignant, but I didn&rsquo;t have to be convinced of them.</p>
<p>And that is fair - it is not the book that he wanted to write. But for me, it was partly the book I wanted to read.</p>
<p>Mark this one as &ldquo;undoubtedly excellent, but I wasn&rsquo;t quite the target audience for the second half&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-shape-of-snakes-by-minette-walters">The Shape of Snakes, by Minette Walters</h4>
<p>Another one of the books recommended to me by my mother in law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting book. On the surface, it presents itself as a murder mystery, and part of me expected it to become a whodunnit. However, it quickly transitions into a third detective book, a third revenge story, and a third exploration of the effects of systemic poverty.</p>
<p>By far the most interesting part of the novel is its main character. She is a strong willed woman who has been treated unfairly by the police, her family and her husband. She has sat on trauma for decades and has had her sense of justice merge with her her thirst for vengeance. Throughout the entire book she swings between wanting revenge, and wanting amends for Annie, the wronged murder victim. She leans equally each one of those motivators, which was quite unexpected. Usually, books either go far into the revenge story and turn the protagonist into a villain or anti-hero; or they go far into the sense of justice and portray a traditional hero. Here, the balance is struck throughout.</p>
<p>Everything stems from this characterization of the main character - her relationship with her husband, Sam, who treated her monstrously to hide his affair, showcases her struggle between a sense of cruelty (at worst) and apathy (at best). She tries to be good and uphold moral ideals, but she is scorned, and often comes across as bitter. Sam often comes across as flawed, selfish through the affair and short tempered; but well meaning and a good husband, if a little weak willed.</p>
<p>I suppose that is what the biggest strength of the book is - all of the main characters are wonderfully complex and not at all portrayed as purely sympathetic. They are fully realized people with flaws, that I sometimes hated, sometimes loved, but always respected in some form, if nothing else because of how <em>lived</em> they feel. They are believable as real people, which is not easy to do. I despised Dury, the corrupt and racist investigator, as well as Maureen Slater, the sadistic animal torturer. But Alan Slater and Michael Percy I despised, pitied, and admired in turn; and the main character I felt sorry for, just chapters before I judged her for her cruelty&hellip; and then a second later admired her resolve and smarts. The range of feeling the characters evoked in me almost gave me whiplash.</p>
<p>The other side of the book is the representation of prejudice, bigotry, and the effects of systemic poverty. Here it goes to shorter lengths than other books, like Kingsolver&rsquo;s <em>Demon Copperhead</em>. But it is still there, if not the central theme of the book. If I took one lesson from it, it would be that it is obvious what massive impact love can have on people who are so deprived of it.</p>
<p>I did not expect characterization this complex in this book, and while I was not super tense for the final confrontation, it pulled feeling out of me, and the ending brought a tear to my eye.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="when-the-saints-by-sarah-mian">When the Saints, by Sarah Mian</h4>
<p>This one details the adventures of Tabby Saint as she returns to her family&rsquo;s hometown of Solace River, in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It is a short, interesting book that was easy to read. There were not any major points at which the prose made me stop in awe, but it was competently written and pleasant, in a very non-sentimental depiction of poverty and the believable humanity of people who have very little to their name. It evoked a lot of the same feelings in me as the first few seasons of Shameless, before it got all melodramatic and soap opera-y, which is definitely a good thing. It also reminded me of a much less ambitious version of <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, by Barbara Kingsolver.</p>
<p>The characters are all quite likeable and by the end of things I was most definitely rooting for Tabby and West to work out. Jannis, Ma and Poppy were all believable, although I did not connect to any of them quite as much.</p>
<p>There is a poignant moment at the end when you keep expecting for things to come crashing down, but it doesn&rsquo;t, and you get to just feel happy for the Saints family.</p>
<p>On top of it, the thing I appreciated the most was the non-saccharine depiction of poverty. Tabby is smart, but she&rsquo;s hard. She never properly shakes up the consequences of her poverty and upbringing. She felt like a real person instead of a stereotype.</p>
<p>The book also made me quite interested in Nova Scotia. I&rsquo;d like to visit at some point.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-dictionary-of-lost-words-by-pip-williams">The Dictionary of Lost Words, by Pip Williams</h4>
<p>This books stayed in my mind in three major sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first section introduces Esme and her life in the Scriptorium while working in the production of the Oxford English Dictionary, first edition. This part I generally found quite boring, which was surprising to me because I felt like in many ways I could identify with Esme a lot. Perhaps that is why I found this section not engaging - realistically, not very much happens in it, and the cast is lovable enough, but perfectly ordinary.</li>
<li>The second section comes with Esme&rsquo;s emancipation, the introduction of Tilda, her brother, and Mabel to the cast of supporting characters. As Esme grows into an adult, this section comes with a lot more interesting things happening - the introduction of the theater as a den of debauchery for the boring little Esme made her far more interesting to read about.</li>
<li>The third section involves the start of World War I, all the way to the end of the novel  This was heart rending - the backdrop of World War I is some true stakes, and Esme becomes a full blown character here as her emancipation continues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first section was really quite boring and I imagine many dropped the book just there.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers below - please skip if you are not willing to read them.</strong></p>
<p>What also didn&rsquo;t particularly work for me was the focus on the child that Esme gives away at the end of the second section, after an unexpected pregnancy.</p>
<p>Esme&rsquo;s death at the end of the novel came seemed like a forced plot device created specifically to fulfill a narrative structure, not developed organically. It threatened my suspension of disbelief, to be blunt; and it upset me to lose Esme so trivially after so much growth. And it happened entirely because her child has a special status - because, for the purpose of generational growth being shown, Esme&rsquo;s child must be in a better world thanks to Esme. But to do the protagonist we&rsquo;ve followed so thoroughly for a while dirty, right as she finally is pulling at my heartstrings, and especially just for the purpose of themes built around the unnamed child - it all felt too artificial.</p>
<p>It also felt a little bit patriarchal - like Esme, this strong, amazing character that grew so much and contributed so much to the Dictionary, needed to expand herself in motherhood to truly reinforce that she is worth something. It does provide a nice conclusion to the lost words plot-line, but why Her, the adopted daughter, instead of Ditte, or any of the many capable people who have made words their life too? And does Esme really need that aspect to redeem her after finding herself and already doing so much?</p>
<p><strong>End of spoilers.</strong></p>
<p>The prose was OK to good: no beautiful passages I had to stop for, but nothing that struck me as particularly bad either.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-memory-police-by-yōko-ogawa">The Memory Police, by Yōko Ogawa</h4>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about Japanese writers - perhaps selection bias from my side, or just randomness, or something about how japanese must be translated to English. But it sounds like all Japanese of writers I have read so far share this sense of almost Portuguese surreal sadness. Haruki Murakami, Kazuo Ishiguro, and now Yoko Ogawa all share it.</p>
<p>The Memory Police is a pretty book, and ultimately a very sad one. It depicts an island where people lose their memories of things - one day, they just wake up and &ldquo;photographs&rdquo; are gone, for example, so no one knows what those little squares with people&rsquo;s faces on it are - at the whims of the <em>Memory Police</em>, an authoritarian entity of borderline automatons that verify things are actually disappeared. The main character is affected by these disappearances, and at the same time interacts with a resistance movement that strives to hide those who remember things even after they have been disappeared. The main character&rsquo;s mother was one of these people, and was taken away by the memory police.</p>
<p>This might sound like an intriguing premise, and it is - but it is not something that the book explores in any great deal of detail. The resistance is never fleshed out; the Memory Police&rsquo;s motives are never found. This is a character book, not a plot driven book, and most of the questions remain unanswered, instead taking a backseat to the phenomenology of the disappearances and the human drive to remember.</p>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a sad book, and it was hard to get through. It has beauty in it, but nothing actually got me excited to go and read it. It was recommended to me by my mother in law, and I can see why it would be recommended - it is an experience, and I&rsquo;m not sure I will forget it soon, but it almost feels like I&rsquo;ll remember it because of its curious vibe, the almost surreal longing and <em>saudade</em> adjacent mythos, more than it actually having taught me anything or having memorable scenes.</p>
<p>A particular callout goes to the scene where the main character&rsquo;s left leg gets disappeared - I wish the book had more of that.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="where-we-have-to-go-by-lauren-kirshner">Where We Have to Go, by Lauren Kirshner</h4>
<p>It is an odd book, and not exactly terrible, but not exactly good either. It follows the main character&rsquo;s journey through growing up in the house of a Bulgarian immigrant mother who is married to a man she doesn&rsquo;t love, and it is a pretty good representation of what it is like to be caught in the middle of a loveless marriage. But, perhaps because of that, it produces a strange effect of oppressiveness after a while. You keep waiting for the character progression or for the narrative to move on, to beyond the bleakness of the loveless marriage and its impacts on the protagonist&rsquo;s life, but even as she grows up, that grey dreariness permeates everything, and it gets tiring quite fast.</p>
<p>Because of that tiresomeness, the book ends up bland. It&rsquo;s not offensive, but it&rsquo;s not memorable in any way, the prose is pretty forgettable, and nothing particularly happens. Even the anorexia the protagonist develops is told in the most flavorless way possible. There are the inklings of interesting themes, but they&rsquo;re never treated with the depth they deserve; the body dysmorphia and self image problems are interesting, but never really go anywhere (they almost made me long for Toni Morrison&rsquo;s <em>The Bluest Eye</em>), for example. The book also ends in a really puzzling way, with the ending feeling like it comes out of nowhere and leads nowhere.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-books-by-leah-price">What We Talk About When We Talk About Books, by Leah Price</h4>
<p>This was not for me, and it was in nearly every way a worse book than <em>The Library Book</em> which I mentioned above.</p>
<p>It tries to demistify the special status of books in people&rsquo;s mind by analyzing them as physical objects, by talking about their history and analyzing their development over the ages. It performs book archaeology.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that this is a book historian more than a book lover, and that I am simply not that interested in thinking about books as physical objects (I am one of those people that keeps books in pristine condition and really dislikes bending them, writing in them, or anything similar), the author&rsquo;s writing is tremendously dull. She makes even the simplest ideas sound like a purple mess, and has a talent for finding the most pretentious, convoluted way possible of getting points across. I seriously struggled to finish this, and don&rsquo;t feel like I got much from it - every time I thought I had finally found something interesting in it, it ended up being overshadowed by a pretentious tangent I could not find a point to.</p>
